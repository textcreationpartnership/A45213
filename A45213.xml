            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

  lay wagers with him the ſaid Mr. Docter <hi>Kingſley</hi> the Archdeacon, that he had done him the ſaid <hi>Huntley</hi> wrong, or the like in effect, without any due reſpect of the ſaid Archdeacon his perſon or place, and to the encouragement of other refractary perſons, as was there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo proved to the Court, for which his groſſe abuſes and contempts, the Court held him well worthy to be puniſhed, and ſo much the rather, becauſe the court was of opinion, and ſo proncunced, that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Huntley</hi> was by the Lords Grace of Cant. his Ordinary &amp; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon aforeſaid injoyned to doe no more, then what by Law and cuſtome according to his canonicall obedience, hee was tyed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, yet nevertheleſſe the court at this time reſerving to themſelves their further cenſure, as occaſion ſhould be offered, for the preſent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered him the ſaid Mr. <hi>Huntley</hi> upon the commandment of the Archdeacon of <hi>Cant.</hi> upon a competent warning to bee given him, to Preach a Sermon at the next Uiſitation to be holden by Mr. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of <hi>Cant.</hi> and afterwards before the Clergy in the ſaid Uiſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to acknowledge his fault in <hi>conceptis verbis,</hi> as ſhall be preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by any three or two of the Commiſſioners Judges of the Court, unto whom it is now referred to ſet down the ſame, &amp; he is juditially admoniſhed, and required to appeare here perſonally in this place, the ſecond court day of the next tearme, to certifie of his due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof accordingly, whereupon afterwards namely, one the 19. of <hi>Aprill Anno Dom.</hi> 1627. at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> aforeſaid, in the County of <hi>Middleſex</hi> aforeſaid, the aforeſaid <hi>George Huntley</hi> then and there, being publikely called, appeared perſonally.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95226:4"/>
  he the ſaid <hi>George Huntley,</hi> then and there acknowledged that he had done neither, and then and there alleaged frivolous matter in excuſe thereof, to witt, that Mr. Archdeacon aforeſaid had not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him by a lawfull proceſſe to Preach. But it appeared to the ſaid Court of high Commiſſion by affidavit made, that the foreſaid Maſter Archdeacon had given him ſufficient warning by a publike officer, and a competent time to provide himſelfe, to Preach a Uiſitation Sermon, and he being a man ſufficiently qualified, by his gifts of learning for that purpoſe, not withſtanding contemptuouſly refuſed to performe his duty therein, and alſo that he the ſaid <hi>George Huntley</hi> refuſed to performe his ſubmiſſion <hi>conceptis verbis,</hi> as was enjoyned unto him: The ſaid Court of High Commiſſion <hi>unamimi conſenſu</hi> prononuced him guilty of a great affront and contempt, not onely to the ſaid Mr. Archdeacon, and the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Cant.</hi> primate of all <hi>England,</hi> and metropolitane, and his the ſaid <hi>Huntleys</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Ordinary, unto whom the ſaid Huntley is tyed by oath, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme canonicall obedience, but alſo againſt his Majeſties ſupreame power and authority in matters and cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, and this Court, unto whom the ſame by Letters Patents under the great Seale of <hi>England</hi> is delegated and committed, and therefore the ſaid Court of high Commiſſion held the ſaid <hi>George</hi> worthie to be puniſhed, and firſt fined him in five hundred pounds to his Majeſties uſe, &amp; commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to the new priſon (namely to the cuſtody of <hi>Brian Wilton,</hi> then warden of the new priſon) and there ordered him to remaine, untill he ſhall give ſufficient bond with ſuerties in a competent ſumme to his Majeſtie uſe, aſwell for the payment of his fine, as it ſhall bee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated as for the performance of his ſubmiſſion heretofore enjoyned him, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Now theſe two parts of the High Commiſſioners firſt finall ſentence, containe the whole originall matter, for which alone the High Commiſſioners aforeſaid did fine me five hundred pounds and impriſoned me on the 19 day of Aprill 1627. and kept me in priſon two whole yeares; And for which alone without any other crime or fault afterward objectd againſt mee in any new articles, or in any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionalls or ſuperadditionalles to the firſt articles, the Commiſſioners did on the 25 day of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1629. by a ſentence, wherin they charge me with grievous and enormous crimes, exceſſes and delicts mentioned in the foreſaid articles, (in which articles there is never a crime char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon me) deprive and degrade me, and thereupon kept me a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner untill the 10 day of <hi>May</hi> 1633. And for which alone, on their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95226:5"/>
laſt court day in Hilarie Terme 1630. they did excommunicate me, becauſe I would not deliver up my orders <hi>diaconatus &amp; presbytera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> And for which alone, yet neither certified into the Exchequer by the h High Commiſſioners together with the fine aforeſaid, nor legally ſeene nor underſtood by the Barons of the Exchequer, my Lord chiefe Baron ſir <hi>Humphrey Daverport</hi> and the other Barons of the Exchequer refuſing to grant me a certiorarj to the High Commiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Court to command them to certfie the cauſe &amp; to permit mee to pleade to the foreſaid fine, did the 10. of May 1633. commit me to the Fleet in execution of the foreſaid fine, &amp; there detained me a full yeare, untill I to procure my liberty, paid the fourth part of the ſaid fine to Mr. <hi>Moterſhed pecunijs numeratis,</hi> and ſtal'd the other three parts to the Kings uſe. And for which, and alſo for a Petition delivered at the Counſell Table to crave juſtice therein according to his Majeſties mandate, under ſir <hi>Edward Powels</hi> hand to my Lord chiefe Juſtice, ſir <hi>Iohn Bramſton</hi> and the other Judges of the Kings Bench court, dated the 29. of <hi>December</hi> 1635. and delivered with mine owne hand to the ſaid Judges in open Court the firſt day of Hilary Tearme 1635. I was by my moſt reverend Dioceſan and provinciall <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Cant.</hi> his Grace, and other right Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords of his Majeſties moſt honorable privie Councell, on the third day of <hi>February</hi> 1636. committed to cuſtodie of the Warden of the Fleet, by a warrant wherein no cauſe of commitment was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, and there detain'd a priſoner by him, untill Trinity Tearme 1639. and then upon an <hi>habeas corpus</hi> iſſuing out of the Kings Bench Court I was brought to that court in Trinity Tearme 1639. and the foreſaid warrant for my commitment returned and then I was preſently bayled, and thereby tyed to appeare in court divers daies, both that Tearme and the Tearme thence next following, and becauſe none of the Kings Counſell in all that time came in againſt me, I was on the laſt day of that Michaelmas Tearme 1639. delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the ſaid baile and impriſonment, by the joynt conſent of all the Reverend Judges then of that court. As I formerly had beene in the ſame court, <hi>Termino paſchae</hi> 1629. after the firſt two yeares im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment upon the foreſaid originall matter, returned to an <hi>habeas,</hi> and fully debated by Counſell on both ſides and Mr Juſtice <hi>Bertley</hi> then the Kings Sergeant in open court profeſſing himſelfe fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And for the former originall matter onely, may for nothing at all in the judgement of the Law, even for the foreſaid ſentence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation and degradation, charging mee with grievous and enormous

            <p>Whence it followeth that if the Commiſſioners aforeſaid firſt finall ſentence againſt me &amp; the 500 pounds fine thereby impoſed upon me, &amp; the two yeares impriſonment thereby ſuſtained by me be juſt &amp; le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, then all the other ſentences, cenſures and puniſhments following and depending thereupon, may be juſt and legall: But if the former the only ground of all the reſt, be unjuſt and illegall, then all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt of neceſſity be unjuſt and illegall.</p>

            <p>The Principall and Eſpeciall are two, as appeares by their firſt finall ſentence alleaged in their plea, wherein they ſay, that upon the opening of the cauſe, they found the aforeſaid <hi>George Huntley</hi> charged in the ſaid Articles, with theſe two perticulers principally<note n="(a)" place="margin">This word ſpecialiter, in this ſence is 3. times uſed in the defendants plea. twice in the firſt part of their firſt finall ſentence, and once in the Commiſſion, &amp; of 14.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95226:6"/>
command him the ſaid Huntley or any other incmbent to preach the ſaid viſitation Sermon.</p>
            <p>The Inferiours or Acceſſories are foure; firſt that the ſaid Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley came unſent for, or uncal'd for to Maſter Arch-deacon afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, he being in his viſitation amongſt the Clergie, and ſitting there to heare cauſes; Secondly that the ſaid Huntley did then and there very malepertly and irreverently charge the ſaid Arch-deacon of falſehood or injuſtice, thirdly that the ſaid Huntley did at the ſame time and place in a very arrogant &amp; irreſpective man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, lay downe an hundred pounds in Gold upon the table and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lay wagers with him the ſaid arch-deacon, that he had done him the ſaid Huntley wrong or the like in effect: and fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and laſtly that the ſaid Huntley refuſed to performe his ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>conceptis verbis</hi> as was enioyned him by the Commiſſioners, and therein gave a great affront and contempt both againſt his Maieſties ſupreame power and authority, in matters and cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, and alſo againſt the high commiſſion court, to whom the ſame by letters patents under the great ſeale of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is delegated and committed.</p>
            <p>And for theſe ſix particulers, the defendants confeſſe, that they impriſon'd me two yeares, namely from the nineteenth day of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1627. to <hi>Aprill</hi> 1629. In which moneth upon my appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in this court the firſt day of that <hi>Eaſter Terme</hi> 1629. to ſave my baile, you Maſter Iuſtice <hi>Heath,</hi> then the Kings Attourney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall were firſt call'd for by the Court in the Kings behalfe againſt me, and you came and confeſt, that you had nothing to ſay againſt me, and then Maſter Iuſtice <hi>Bertley</hi> being then the Kings Sergeant, whoſe<note n="(b)" place="margin">Maſter Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice Bertley at this time was in the cuſtody of the Sheriffe of London.</note>abſence I much lament, whoſe preſence I much deſire, was called for by the court for the ſame purpoſe againſt mee, and hee came and confeſt, that he had formerly ſpoken twice againſt mee upon the matter return'd to the <hi>habeas corpus</hi> (which was the very ſame for ſubſtance, that is now pleaded againſt mee) and hee then further added, that he was now ſatisfied, he had no more to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; and yet the court would not upon that day deliver me, but ordered mee to make my appearance in court two ſeverall dayes after that, and then when no man came in againſt mee, I was on 29. day of that moneth of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1629. delivered by the joynt conſent of all the reverend Iudges, then of this court, and therein, (I ſpeake it with ſinguler exultation) I received as much favour as a Rogue at Newgate, who when no man comes

in againſt him, is acquitted by Proclamation, which is the moſt that I could ever get ſince, except it were greater injuries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, I ſpeake it with much greife, and lamentation.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord the two principall, and eſpeciall pretended faults againſt mee, will deſcide the whole controverſie betweene me and my adverſaries, and either juſtifie them, and condemne mee, or elſe condemne them, and juſtifie me, for if the defendants can make good theſe two Principall or Eſpeciall pretended faults againſt me, that my refuſall to Preach the Arch-deacons viſitation Sermon is a breach of Canonicall obedience, and that I in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it to be the Arch-deacons duely to Preach his owne viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation Sermon, have raiſed among the Clergy a new opinion contrary to the Canons, then I ſhall confeſſe my ſelfe faulty in all the reſt, and juſtly fin'd, impriſon'd, depriv'd degraded and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. But if the defendants faile in theſe two points, being by their owne Teſtimony, the two Principall and eſpeciall points againſt mee, then they faile and fall in all the reſt, for according to their law; <hi>Siprincipalis cauſa non ſubſiſtat, ea quae ſequuntur, locum non habent.</hi> And then your Lordſhip and the court, are not to give credit unto the defendants in any other part of their plea, that makes either for them or againſt mee, for <hi>qui ſemel eſt malus, ſemper, preſumitur malus in eodem genere mali,</hi> and <hi>qui ſemel ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis &amp; verecundiae limites tranſilierit, eum oportet eſſe guaviter imprudentem, nec ei deinceps niſi paenitenti, culpam conſitenti, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam expetenti, eſt in aliquo credendum.</hi> And therefore if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants haue wittingly, and willingly, palpably and groſſely falſified the law in the principals, Your Lordſhip and the court are not to give credit unto them in the acceſſories. If in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalls they have called my obedience to the word of God, to the Articles, Statutes, Canons, to his Maieſties Letters Patents, roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Prerogative and oath of ſupremacy (which are all extant to the veiw of the world) a breach of Canonicall obedience, a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall or eſpeciall fault, a greivous and enormous crime, what cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is to be given unto them concerning any fact, they charge me with in the Acceſſories, ſeing therein they may ſpeak falſe ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not be confuted by any law, as in the former? And ſo my Lord, having ſtated the controverſie betweene me and my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries concerning the points of the Canon law in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us, I proceed to ſpeak to the controverſie thus ſtated, and firſt to the principalls.</p>

            <p>This appeares out of the High Commiſſion ſentence alleaged in the defendants plea, put in to my Declaration, for therein they ſay, that upon the opening of the cauſe, they found me charged in the ſaid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles with theſe two particulers principally or eſpecially, firſt that I refuſed to Preach a Uiſitation Sermon at the Arch-deacons command contrary to my canonicall obedience, and ſecondly that I ſet up an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion amonſt the Clergy, that the ſaid Arch-deacon had no power to command me or any other incumbent to Preach the ſaid Uiſitation Sermon.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, if theſe two be my Principall or Eſpeciall faults, as the defendants themſelves confeſſe they are, <hi>&amp; teſtimonium ab ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſario contra ſe fortiſsimum,</hi> then by the force of compariſon drawn from the adverſaries owne eſtimate, all the other muſt needs be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and acceſſory, and then if the Principall or Eſpeciall faults prove no juſt cauſes of impriſonement nay further prove no faults at all nay further yet, prove vertues and eminent vertues even the vertues of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall obedience, much leſſe can the inferiours or acceſſories be any faults or any juſt cauſes of impriſonement, for according to their owne law, <hi>acceſſorium debet ſequi naturam principalis, &amp; ſi principalis cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa non ſubſiſtat ea quae ſequuntur locum non habent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now my Lord theſe two Principall or Eſpeciall faults pretended againſt me, doe beget two Principall or Eſpeciall queſtions, the one of practiſe and action, and it is this; whether my refuſall to preach the Arch-deacons Uiſitation Sermon be a breach of Canonicall obedience, or not? the other of Speculation and Opinion and it is this; whether this my opinion that the Archdeacon hath no power to command me or any other incumbent to Preach his Uiſitation Sermon, be held and publiſhed contrary to the Canons, or not? And theſe two queſtions are ſo lincked together that they do <hi>invieem ſe ponere &amp; auferre</hi> &amp; are to be both, either joyntly affirmed or joyntly denied, for if my refuſall to Preach the Arch-deacons Uiſitation Sermon, be a breach of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obedience, then this my opinion, that the Arch-deacon hath no

power to command mee or any other incumbent to Preach his Uiſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſermon muſt of neceſſity be held &amp; publiſhed contrary to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. And on the contrary, if this my refuſall to preach the arch-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons Uiſitation Sermon, be no breach of Canonicall obedience, then this my opinion that the arch-deacon hath no power to command me or any other incumbent to preach his Uiſitation Sermon, is neither held nor publiſhed contrary to the Canons: ſo that handle one, handle both, cleere one, cleere both, and faile in one, faile in both.</p>
            <p>And this firſt Principall or Eſpeciall queſtion of practiſe and action, whether my refuſall to preach the Arch-deacons Uiſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sermon be a breach of Canonicall obedience, or not? Doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, that is, whether it be or be not, beget another queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, If it be a breach of Canonicall obedience, then it begets this queſtion; whether for the breach of a Canon, or of Canonicall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto the Canons, according to the lawes and cuſtomes of this land, men are to be fetcht from the judgement and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the ordinary up to the High Commiſſion Court, and there to be fined and impriſoned for it, or elſe whether they are to be left to the judgement and juriſdiction of the ordinary, and he to proceed againſt them according to the power of the keies?</p>
            <p>And though my Lord, this queſtion be no queſtion, if the high Commiſſioners by the firſt of the firſt of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> never had any power to fine or impriſon for any crime within that ſtatute, and the cogniſance of the high Commiſſion, as is declared by a ſtatute made the firſt Seſſion of this Parliament, which ſtatute makes wholely for me, and againſt the high Commiſſioners, and puts the former queſtion out of queſtion: yet my Lord in favour of the high Commiſſioners, and to my owne diſadvantage, I doe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to take the benefit and advantage of the former ſtatute and Declaration, and granting to the high Commiſſioners a power to fine and impriſon for crimes, within the firſt of the firſt of <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> according to the Commiſſioners practiſe before, and at the time of my cenſure, according to the wordes of their commiſſion, and the approbation both of the Exchequer, who did impriſon me for the 500. pounds fine eſtreated by the high Commiſſioners into the Exchequer, and of this Court alſo, which would not upon an <hi>habeas corpus</hi> deliver me from that impriſonement: I doe in this ſence and reſpect onely, propoſe the former queſtion, whether for the breach of a Canon or Canonicall obedience unto the canons,

either <hi>iure, privilegio, vel conſuetudine:</hi> yet <hi>de iure communi,</hi> over the whole Dioceſſe, the Biſhop only is Ordinary, and onely hath a generall and an univerſall juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>And this generall juriſdiction of the ordinary or Biſhop extends not to all cauſes both Temporall and Eccleſiaſticall, but only to all cauſes meerely Spirituall, ſo called not in reſpect of their owne nature, but becauſe they are aſſign'd to the Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thoſe are of two ſorts, either civill Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, as Tithes, Oblations, Legacies Pentions, and portions, or elſe criminall cauſes, and both theſe belong to the generall juriſdiction of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, for the former it appeares principally in two <hi>cap. of Lyndewodes Provinc.</hi> and that in the very text, firſt in his ſecond booke <hi>tit. de foro competenti. cap. circumſpecte agatis,</hi> which though it be King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. direction to his Judges or Juſtices or Commiſſioners concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> and other of the Clergy, and bee extant among the Statutes 13. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. yet ſeeing it treates of the ſpirituall juriſdiction of Ordinaries, it is ſet downe by <hi>Lyndewode</hi> among the provinciall conſtitutions of our Archbiſhops of <hi>Cant.</hi> Secondly, in his 5. booke <hi>tit. de paenis, cap. aeternae Sanctio voluntatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the latter, namely criminall cauſes, it appeares both in the two chapters before alleaged, and more eſpecially in the firſt booke of <hi>Lyndewodes Provinc. tit. de conſtitutionib. c. exterior habitus. ver. Inquirant.</hi> upon which word <hi>Lyndewode</hi> ſhewes, that there is <hi>triplex inquiſitio, generaliſsima, generalis &amp; ſpecialis vel ſingularis.</hi> and each of theſe is twofold, either <hi>praeparatoria</hi> or <hi>Solemnis, praeparatoria eſt fine exactione juramenti, ſolemnis eſt cum juramento,</hi> and the one of theſe makes way and worke for the other. The preparatory inquiſition findes out and ſtarts the game, and the ſolemne inquiſition perſues and takes it.</p>
            <p>And the moſt generall inquiſition both preparatory and ſolemne belongs to a generall councell or to a provinciall Synode; but the inquiſition generall and ſpeciall both preparatory and ſolemne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the juriſdiction of the Ordinary. And this generall inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath three degrees; for it is generall either in reſpect both of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and of crimes: or it is generall onely in reſpect of perſons, and ſpeciall or ſingular in reſpect of crimes or laſtly it is generall in reſpect of crimes and ſpeciall or ſingular in reſpect of perſons, as the Ordinary ſhall thinke fit, and the matter require.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, the High Commiſſion hath nothing to doe with the firſt of theſe cauſes, namely civill Eccleſiaſticall cauſes: no nor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95226:9"/>
a generall juriſdiction in the latter, namely criminall cauſes, and both theſe are evident by divers judgements at the common Law.</p>
            <p>Hilary. 8. <hi>Iacobi,</hi> In the common Pleas in the caſe of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Clifford</hi> it was reſolved, that the High Commiſſion had not power to meddle with civill Eccleſiaſticall cauſes and therefore none might ſue before them for Tythes, Legacies, Oblations Pentions or Portions. Firſt becauſe this would bee a meanes to take away all Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall proceedings from the Ordinary. Secondly, becauſe their ſentences and Decrees are finall, and no appeale lieth from them, ſo that it might be very miſcheivous if they ſhould hold plea of all manner of Eccleſiaſticall cauſes. Thirdly, becauſe the firſt of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> giveth them power only in enormities. 1. in hainous, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and exorbitant crimes.</p>
            <p>In the Exchequer in <hi>Ailemers</hi> caſe, it was reſolved that the High Commiſſion might not meddle to puniſh one for working upon holy dayes, &amp; 44 <hi>Eliz. rot.</hi> 1255. in the Common Pleas in the caſe of <hi>Tailer</hi> and <hi>Maſſe,</hi> a prohibition was granted, where one was convented before the high Commiſſion for giving irreverend ſpeeches of a Miniſter for carrying his corne on holy daies, and for not ſuffering the Parſon and pariſhioners to goe through his yard upon Rogation weeke, and for not giving them a repaſt in the perambulation, as hee had uſed to doe, and for whiſtling and knoeking upon the doore of the parſon, and ſaying, hee did it to make the parſon muſick for the marriage of his Daughter, for this ought to be before the Dioceſan.</p>
            <p>But my Lord there is one caſe at the common Law, which I more eſteeme than the three former, becauſe in this very point it conteines not only the reſolution of all the reverend Judges then of this Court, but alſo a reall confeſſion of the High Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners themſelves my very adverſaries, and that's this mire owne caſe: for the high Commiſſioners did at firſt <hi>Paſohae</hi> 1627. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt me to priſon for breach of canonicall obedience in refuſing to Preach the Archdeacons Uiſitation Sermon, &amp; after two yeares impriſonment, when upon an <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> I was ſet at liberty by the court <hi>paſchae</hi> 1629. becauſe that matter was <hi>coram non ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice:</hi> then <hi>trinitatis</hi> 1629 in their ſecond finall ſentence upon the ſame Articles, wherein there is no crime objected againſt mee, they charge me with grievous and enormous crimes mentioned in the Articles, that ſo they might make the matter <hi>coram judice,</hi> and within the cogniſance of the High Commiſſion. So that by

the canon and common Law and by the reall confeſſion of my very adverſaries, the breaches of Canons or of Canonicall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto the Canons belongs to the Juriſdiction of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and onely grievous and enormous crimes to the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of the High Commiſſion court.</p>

But this would bee a great labour, and will

ſhew, that be the fault never ſo great, ſo that the ordinary by vertue of his ſubordinate juriſdiction, cannot ſufficiently puniſh it, yet it may be ſufficiently puniſhed by the Kings ſupreame juriſdiction within the land without going to the Pope out of the land for by that paragraph that is inveſted in the crowne, which by the former paragraph was aboliſhed and extinguiſht in others, and in the former para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph all forraigne uſurped power onely, and not the ordinary ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction is extinguiſht.

Preſbiteri verbis, in virtute obedientiae,</hi> ſhewes, is ſuch obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as the canons and conſtitutions rightly made and publiſhed doe require, and the Cannon law ſhewes, that this canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience conſiſts in theſe three things. In <hi>reverentia exhibenda, in mundato ſuſcipiendo, &amp; in iudicio ſubeundo.</hi> In yeilding canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reverence to the ordinaries perſon, in undertaking his cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall mandates, and in ſtanding to his canonicall judgements. And therefore my Lord, as wee the incumbents by taking this oath of Canonicall obedience, are bound by this oath in thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Canons to ſtand to the ordinaries canonicall judgements: ſo the ordinary by adminiſtring this oath unto us, and by accepting this oath from us, is bound by this oath in things concerning the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to judge us according to the canons. And by both theſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that the breaches of canons, or of Canonicall obedience unto the Canons, belongs to the Juriſdiction of the ordinary, and not to the cogniſance of the High Commiſſion Court.</p>
            <p>And this reaſon my Lord is ſtronger againſt my adverſaries by their own confeſſion in their plea then it is in truth and by my allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the defendants in their plea challeng canonical obedience from every incumbent to and for every ordinary, and they do extend this canonicall obedience not onely ſo farre as the Canons, but alſo as far as the lawes in generall and the cuſtome reacheth: and therefore in challenging canonicall obedience from every incumbent to and for every ordinary, and in extending that canonicall obedience not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo farre as the Canons, but alſo as farre as the laws in generall and the cuſtome reacheth, they doe under the name of canonicall obedience challenge from every incumbent to and for every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a juriſdiction as generall, as the canons, lawes in generall and the cuſtome will warrant; whieh is as generall as can be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they would bring in arbitrary and blind obedience.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:95226:12"/>
of the high Commiſſion, is taken from the opinion of our late Lord and Soveraigne King <hi>Iames,</hi> and of Arch-biſhop <hi>White-gift,</hi> whereof the former being <hi>ad miraculmm uſque acutiſsimus,</hi> did in his time give the authority to the High Commiſſion court, and the latter being a Biſhop according to this rule of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop muſt be holy, juſt, and unrebukeable, was in his time the cheife perſon under the other to excerciſe and execute that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the high Commiſſion court. And this their opinion, as it was at firſt publickely deliv'rd in a ſolemne aſſembly of the church to reforme what was amiſſe, and confirme what was well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: ſo it hath beene extant in print to the view of the world full 30. yeares and upwards in a Treatiſe ſtil'd, the ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court. In the eighty ninth pag. whereof King <hi>Iames</hi> makes this exception againſt the High Commiſſioners, that the matters wherein they dealt, were baſe and meane, and ſuch as ordinaries at home in their owne juriſdictions might cenſure whereunto in the 90. pag. Arch-biſhop <hi>Whitegift</hi> anſwereth, that though the matters be baſe and meane, and the fault of that nature that the ordinary juriſdiction may cenſure it, yet in two caſes, no more, onely in two caſes the high Commiſſion may interpoſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when the party delinquent is to great, ſo that the ordinary dares not proceed againſt him. or,</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſo wealthy in his eſtate, or ſo wilfull in his contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that he will not obey the ſummons and cenſure of the ordinary, and ſo the ordinary is forced to crave helpe at the High commiſſion</p>
            <p>And it ſeemes My Lord, that the High Commiſſioners, and the defendants would make this latter my caſe, for in the 14. Article objected againſt me in the high Commiſſion court, and pleaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me in this court by the defendants, they both ſay, that the ordinary deſired the aſſiſtance of the High commiſſion againſt me.</p>
            <p>But it is certaine, My Lord, that in this matter I am not within either of theſe caſes, for I being but a Presbyter, and of a ſingle benefice, am not ſo great, as great as I am and as great as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants would make me that the ordinary my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Primate of all <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be afraid to proceed againſt me at his ordinary juriſdiction if his cauſe were good; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was I ever contumacious, for I was never ſummoned or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to appeare at the ordinary juriſdiction. And therefore in this caſe ſeeing the fault, if it be a fault is but petty and ſmall, but the
<pb facs="tcp:95226:13"/>
breach of a canon or of canonicall obedience unto the canons <hi>teſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ad verſarijs;</hi> the perſon but meane &amp; poore, but a Presbyter, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, an incumbent, and that onely of a ſingle benefice, and never any waies contumacious, this matter belongs not to the cogniſance of the High commiſſion but to the juriſdiction of the ordinary and then it hath beene all this while <hi>coram non judice,</hi> and ſo the ſentence and whole proceedings are utterly voyd. And thus much concerning this firſt queſtion, which my refuſall to preach the Archdeacons viſitation Sermon, if it be a breach of Canonicall obedience, begets namely that the breaches of canons or of canonicall obedience to the canons accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes and cuſtomes of his land, belong to the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ordinary, and not to the cogniſance of the High commiſſion court; or that for the breach of a canon or of canonicall obedience to the canons according to the Lawes and cuſtomes of this land men are not to be fetcht from the judgement &amp; juriſdiction of the Ordinary up to the High Commiſſion court, and there to be fin'd &amp; impriſond but are to be left to the judgement and juriſdicton of the ordinary, and he to proceede againſt them according to the power of the Keies.</p>
            <p>Now on the other ſide, my Lord if this my refuſall to preach the Archdeacons viſitation ſermon, be no breach of canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, then it begets this queſtion, whether the high commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, your Lordſhip this court, the Barons of the Exchequer, and the Lords of the counſell have power to puniſh me for that which is no fault, no breach of any law? And leaſt the high commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; this court, the Barons of the Exchequer, and the Lordes of the counſell ſhould all thinke to eſcape by maintaining the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, that they have power to puniſh me for that which is no fault, no breach of any law, and peradventure in a deſperate caſe, they will not ſticke to maintaine a deſperate opinion, eſpecially ſeeing your Lordſhip hath ſhew'd and lead them all the way. For <hi>termino trinitatis</hi> 1637. When your Lordſhip delivered your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the eſpeciall verdict betweene <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Naſh,</hi> your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip not onely affirmed the high commiſſion ſentence of depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and degradation againſt me, but alſo maintained, that your Lordſhip and this court were bound to affirme it, whether it were true or falſe, grounded upon a cauſe or upon no cauſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore my Lord, to ſtoppe up that gap, to prevent that ſtarting hole, to overthrow that parodox, and with one argument to confute thoſe foure Honorable, ſenates whereof the firſt and the laſt, the high commiſſioners and the Lords of the counſell chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

as great authority, as the King himſelfe hath, and all of you in this my caſe uſurpe a greater, for you all puniſh me for that which is no fault, no breach of any law: I muſt in the firſt place <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Theſis </seg>1</label> ſhew, that no Magiſtrate whatſoever, no not the ſupreame, hath any power, prerogative, or authority to puniſh any man within his juriſdiction, except it be for ſome fault, ſome offence, ſome vice, ſome error, ſome evill, ſome ſinne, ſome tranſgreſſion of ſome law. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Theſis </seg>2</label> And ſecondly I muſt ſhew, that my refuſall to preach the Arch-deacons Viſitation Sermon, my principall or eſpeciall fault in the judgement of my adverſaries, is no fault, no offence, no vice, no error, no evill, no ſinne, no tranſgreſſion of any Law whatſoever: and that therefore neither the high commiſſioners, your Lordſhip, this court, the Barons of the Exchequer, the Lords of the counſell, nor any other Magiſtrate whatſoever, no not the ſupreme, hath any power, prerogative, or authority, to puniſh me, muchleſſe to impriſon me for it.</p>
            <p>And for the firſt of theſe poſitions, that no Magiſtrate whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no not the ſupreame, hath any power,<note place="margin">Theſis 1. Tractatio.</note> prerogative or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to puniſh any man within his juriſdiction, except it be for ſome fault, ſome offence, ſome vice, ſome error, ſome evill, ſome ſinne, ſome tranſgreſſion of ſome law, this appeares out of the 13. chapter to the <hi>Rom.</hi> verſe. 3. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of that Magiſtrate, to whom the ſword is committed, of that Magiſtrate, to whom we pay tribute, of that magiſtrate, to whom we muſt ſubmit, not onely for wrath, but for conſcience ſake, of that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to whom every ſoule is to be ſubject, that is, of the ſoveraigne, ſupreme, Monarchicall Magiſtrate, Gods immediate deputy and vicegerent, he ſaith of that Magiſtrate, the Magiſtrate is not a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to good workes, but to evill. wilt thou then be without feare of the power? doe well, ſo ſhalt thou have praiſe of the ſame, for he is the Miniſter of God for thy wealth. But if thou do evill, then feare, for he beares not the ſword in vaine, for he is the Miniſter of God, to take vengeance on him that doth evill, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> then is cleere, that no Magiſtrate whatſoever, can juſtly puniſh any man, except it be for ſome evill.</p>
            <p>And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifies as much 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. chap. 13. and 14. <hi>verſes. Submit your ſelves, ſaith he, to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be unto the King, as the ſupreame, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to governours as them, that are ſent of him, ſent of him, for what purpoſe? Even for the ſame purpoſe, that he before is ſent of God,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95226:14"/>
namely for the puniſhment of them that doe evill, and for the praiſe of them tbat doe well.</hi> So that by the expreſſe word of God, no Magiſtrate whatſoever, no not the ſupreame, hath any power, prerogative or authority to puniſh any man within his juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except it be for ſome fault, ſome offence, ſome vice, ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſome evill, ſome ſinne, ſome tranſgreſſion of ſome law.</p>
            <p>And this much, my Lord, <hi>king Artaſhaſt</hi> ſaw by the very light of nature, as appeares by the wordes of his Commiſſion, granted to <hi>Ezra,</hi> and expreſſed <hi>Ezra.</hi> 7. <hi>chap.</hi> 25. 26. <hi>verſe, And thou Ezra (after the wiſedome of thy God, that is in thy hand) ſet Magiſtrates and Iudges, which may judge all the people beyond the river, even all that know the law of thy God and teach-yee them, that know it not. And whoſoever will not doe the law of thy God, and the law of thy King, let judgement be ſpeedily executed upon him, whether it be unto death, or to baniſhment, to confifcation of goods, or to impriſonment.</hi> In which wordes King <hi>Artaſhaſt, juſt</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before did, gives power unto <hi>Ezra</hi> to puniſh men, not for well doing, but for evill doing, no for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but for breaking Gods lawes and the Kings, not for obedience, but for diſobedience, not for vertue but for vice.</p>
            <p>Nay God himſelfe chalengeth no greater prerogative, then to reward the obſervers and to puniſh the tranſgreſſers of his law. Curſed be he, ſaith <hi>Moſes, that confirmeth not all the wordes of Gods law to doe them. Deut.</hi> 27. or as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Curſed is every man, that continueth not in all things, which are written in the booke of the law to doe them.</hi> And if they onely, who breake Gods law, be curſed, then all thoſe who keep his law, muſt needs be bleſſed, and this much <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the <hi>Iſraelites Deut.</hi> 11. <hi>Behold ſaith he, I ſet before you this day a Blesſing and a Curſe, the Blesſing, if ye obey the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord your God, The Curſe if ye will not obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Lord your God.</hi> And if God the ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of all the world, and the creator of all men and Magiſtrates will not puniſh any man, except it be for ſome breach of his law, how can any of his deputy Magiſtrates, without pride or preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion arrogate more, or chalenge any power, prerogative or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to puniſh any man for that which is no fault, no offence, no vice, no error, no evill, no ſinne, no tranſgreſſion of any law whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And here now my Lord behold the conformity both of our
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95226:14"/>
Kings and of the lawes of our Kingdom unto the word of God in this particuler, our<note n="(d)" place="margin">King Iames confeſſeth ſo much in his ſpeech to the Lords &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons at white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday 21 Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii 1609. p. 12. &amp; pag. 13. hee ſaith, all Kings that are not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants or periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wil be glad to bound them ſelves within the Jimites of their lawes, &amp; they that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwad them the contrary, are vipers &amp; peſts, both againſt them and the Common Wealth.</note> Kings chalenge no more, our lawes made by their owne appointment, confirmed by their owne authority, which by oath they are bound to maintaine, and which his<note n="(e)" place="margin">K. Charles in his declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all his loving ſubiects publiſhed by the advice of his privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell 1641. pag. 20. ſaith wee doubt not, it will bee the moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble declaration a King can make to his ſubiects, that for our part we are reſolved not only duely to obſerve the lawes Our ſelfe, but to mainetaine them againſt what oppoſition ſoever; though with the hazard of our being.</note> Majeſty profeſſeth, he will maintaine againſt whatſoever oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the hazard of his owne being, gives them no more. This appeares out of the firſt of the firſt of <hi>Eliz.</hi> an act to reſtore unto the crowne the ancient juriſdiction over the ſtate Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, which Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in <hi>Cawdreys</hi> caſe calls, an act one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declaratory and aſſertory of the ancient juriſdiction of the Crowne, not collatory or introductory of any new right. And what juriſdiction doth that act reſtore, or more properly declare to be reſtored to the Crowne? Namely all ſuch ſpirituall and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall juriſdiction, as by any manner ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power or authority hath heretofore beene, or may lawfully be exerciſed for the Uiſitation of the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall, and for the reformation of all manner errors, hereſies, ſchiſmes, abuſes, faults, offences, contempts, enormities.</p>
            <p>In which wordes, my Lord, there are three things expreſſed, incident to the ancient juriſdiction of the Crowne.</p>
            <p>Firſt it is Soveraigne and ſupreame, over and above all, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and abrogating all forreigne, including but not abrogating all domeſticke juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is ſuch a juriſdiction, as may lawfully be exerciſed, it is not then an unlawfull, but a lawfull juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly it is for the reformation of all errors, hereſies, ſchiſmes, abuſes faults, offences contempts, enormities. It is no power then to puniſh men for truthes for conformity to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and diſcipline eſtabliſhed for vertues, for obedience to the Eccleſiaſticall lawes of this land, no, but for errors, hereſies, ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, abuſes, faults, offences, contempts enormities.</p>
            <p>And this my Lord doth likewiſe appeare by the end of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient juriſdiction of the Crowne expreſſed in that ſtatute, which is, that all thinges in the Eccleſiaſticall courts by vertue of that ancient Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction of the Crowne may be done to the pleaſure of Almighty God to the increaſe of vertue, and to the maintenance of the peace and unity of this realme.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord if the end of that ancient juriſdiction of the Crowne be for the maintenance of the peace and unity of this realme, then that ancient iuriſdiction of the Crowne, cannot pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95226:15"/>
men for peace and unity, but for diſcord and diſſention; not for obeying the lawes of this land, which is a principall meanes, to maintaine the peace and unity of this realme, but for violating the lawes of the land, which is a forcible meanes to breed diſcord and diſſention.</p>
            <p>Againe, if the end of that ancient juriſdiction of the Crowne, be for the increaſe of vertue, then that ancient juriſdiction of the Crowne cannot puniſh men for their vertues, but for their vices, for otherwiſe that would be a meanes to decreaſe vertue, and to increaſe vice.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, ſeeing the end of that ancient juriſdiction of the Crowne, is, that thereby all thinges in the Eccleſiaſticall courts ſhould be done to the pleaſure of Almighty God, and the pleaſure of Almighty God, as I have before ſhew'd out of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> is, that the Magiſtrate ſhall not be a terror to good workes but to evill; Therefore the ancient juriſdiction of the Crowne cannot puniſh men for well doing. but for evill doing, not for keeping, but for breaking Gods lawes and the Kings, not for obedience, but for diſobedience, not for vertue but for vice.</p>
            <p>And this much my Lord, is evident by all lawes, for all lawes doe conſiſt of a direction and a puniſhment, and they inflict the puniſhment onely upon the tranſgreſſers, not upon the obſervers of the direction of the law, and this the Apoſtle ſheweth in his 1. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. to Tim. chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. We know the law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully, howes that? why thus, knowing this, ſaith the Apoſtle that the law is not given to the righteous, but to the lawleſſe and diſobedient, what is not the law given to the righteous, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the direction, not in reſpect of the puniſhment, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he obſerveth the direction of the law, he is freed from the puniſhment of the law, but to the lawleſſe and diſobedient, the law is given in reſpect both of the direction and puniſhment, and becauſe they obſerve not the direction of the law, they and they onely are liable to the puniſhment of the law, and thereupon if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny judge ſhall impoſe the puniſhment of the law, upon any that doth not violate the direction of the law, he croſſes and confounds the very law it ſelfe, and incurres that foule fault committed by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Thou ſitteſt to judge me after the law, and contrary to the law commandeſt thou me to be ſmitten? And therefore my Lord ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature, property, and purpoſe of all lawes, is to ſecure the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95226:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
obſervers, and to lay the puniſhment of the law onely upon the violaters of the direction of the law, It is needleſſe to alleage any more particuler lawes, to prove that which is the ſcope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all lawes. Yet I cannot pretermit one, and I will alleage but one law of the land more to this purpoſe, and that's the twenty nine chapter of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> moſt fully and ſtrongly confirmed 3. <hi>Caroli,</hi> by the Kings Majeſty, in his anſwer to the Commons Petition of right in theſe wordes, let right be done, as is deſired ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that twenty nine chapter of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>

            <p>Nay further my Lord, this law muſt be a knowne law; for by the law is the knowledge of ſinne, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. and by what law is the knowledge of ſinne? ſurely by a knowne law, not by an unknowne law, for ſeeing ſinne is the tranſgreſſion of the law, he that will know ſin, which is the tranſgreſſion of the Law, muſt know it by the law tranſgreſt, and therefore he muſt firſt know, that law which is tranſgreſt; and this the Apoſtle doth expreſſely and pregnantly ſhew <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>What ſhall we ſay</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is the Law ſinne? God forbid; nay I know not ſinne, but by the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95226:17"/>
Law for I had not knowne luſt,</hi> to be a ſinne, <hi>unleſſe the law had ſaid thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> So that firſt we know the Law, and then by vertue of the law, we know ſinne, which is the tranſgreſſion of the Law.</p>
            <p>And here my Lord, I muſt againe repeate the Apoſtles queſtion, <hi>What ſhall we ſay,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is the Law ſinne? God forbid,</hi> yea, God forbid it in deede, my Lord, for if the law be ſinne, then the lawyers <hi>cujuſcunque generis, eo nomine</hi> are ſinners, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lawyers, the greater ſinners, and Judges the greateſt of Lawyers, the greateſt of ſinners and how ſhall wee avoid or confute this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, my Lord, which to toucheth all our copyholds. Why, juſt as the Apoſtle doth the former. The Apoſtle proves the law to bee no ſinne, becauſe the law diſcovers, forbids, condemnes, and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth ſinne. And if the Lawyers doe ſo, then the Lawyers <hi>cujuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque generis, eo nomine</hi> are no ſinners but the ornaments both of Church and common wealth, and Gods Miniſters and Deputies to reforme and preſerve both. But if in ſteed of diſcovering ſinne, they conceale ſinne, in ſtead of forbidding ſinne, they command ſinne, in ſtead of condemning ſinne, they juſtifie ſinne, and in ſtead of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinne, they patronize, protect and preferre ſinne, then Lawyers <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſcunque generis eo nomine</hi> are ſinners, and the greater lawyers the greater ſinners, and judges the greateſt of Lawyers, the greateſt of ſinners, for as the law doth firſt diſcover ſinne, and then condemne and puniſh it: ſo muſt Judges, firſt diſcover a particular ſinne, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular tranſgreſſion of law, and particular law tranſgreſt, and then condemne and puniſh it. Otherwiſe they are not judges according unto law, but ſinners againſt law, and their very act and worke of judging, in reſpect of the anomy, obliquity and irregularity of it, is not judging according unto law, but ſinning againſt the law.</p>
            <p>Nay my Lord, not onely Judges, but every man is to ſhew unto his brother, his particular ſinne, his particular tranſgreſſion of law, and the perticular law tranſgreſt, even by Gods owne expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but thou ſhalt plainely reprove him, and not ſuffer ſinne upon him, and if every man muſt plainely reprove his brother, and not ſuffer ſin upon him, then every man muſt plainely ſhew his brother his particular ſinne; and if every man muſt plainely ſhew his brother his particular ſinne, then ſeeing ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt plainely ſhew his brother his particular tranſgreſſion of law, and if every man muſt plainely ſhew his brother the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95226:17"/>
tranſgreſſion of law, then every man muſt plainely ſhew his brother the particular law tranſgreſt. And if every man muſt doe this in love as a brother, then ever Judge muſt doe it, both in love as a brother, and in Juſtice as a Judge: and therefore no Magiſtrate whatſoever, no not the ſupreame, can juſtly inflict any wrath or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon any man whomſoever unleſſe he firſt diſcover in him and to him, to him and in him, ſome particuler fault, ſome particuler offence, ſome particuler vice, ſome particuler error, ſome particuler evill, ſome particuler ſinne, ſome particuler tranſgreſſion of Law.</p>
            <p>And by this, my Lord, it appeares, that the two finall ſentences of the High Commiſſion Court againſt mee, are both voide: firſt that of the deprivation and degradation, becauſe in twelve ſheets as it it ſtands upon record in this Court, it mentions no one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fault, but onely generalls, namely grievous and enormous crimes, exceſſes &amp; delicts <hi>contumacies contempts</hi> &amp; <hi>incorrigibilities,</hi> &amp; therfore my Honored Lord Cheife juſtice, under favour your L<hi rend="sup">P</hi>. was much miſtaken, when your Lordſhip delivering your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the ſpeciall verdict between <hi>Alllen</hi> &amp; <hi>Naſh</hi> did paralell my caſe and <hi>Caudreys</hi> caſe in the principall point.

            </p>
            <p>But the principall point and queſtion in <hi>Caudreys</hi> caſe was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the High Commiſſioners had perſued the forme of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or not, in depriving <hi>Caudrey</hi> upon his firſt conviction, who by the Statute, the 2 of the 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was to be deprived upon his ſecond conviction, which is no point or queſtion in my caſe. And if your Lordſhip will paralell theſe two caſes in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall point, your Lordſhip muſt either ſhew, that the ſentence found againg <hi>Caudrey</hi> did not charge <hi>Caudrey</hi> with any particuler crime
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95226:18"/>
within any branch of the Commiſſion found, but onely with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, as in my caſe. Or elſe that the ſentence found againſt me, doth charge me, not onely with generalls, but alſo with ſome particuler crime within ſome branch of the Commiſſion found, as in <hi>Caudreys</hi> caſe. And unleſſe your Lordſhip can doe one of theſe two, your Lordſhip may ſooner bring together <hi>Hercules</hi> his two pillers, or the two poles, then paralell our two caſes in the principall point. And untill then, this ſentence containing onely generalls, ſhall according to Gods word, the word of truth, ſtand charg'd and branded with injuſtice and uncharitableneſſe, and in reſpect of the anomy obliquity and enormity of it, ſhall be taken by all men of ſound judgement to bee as indeede it is not a ſentence according unto law, but a ſinne, and a foule ſinne againſt law; or rather to uſe the words of that erronious ſentence in a true ſence, a grievous and enormous crime contrary to the Law, and therefore voide. And both the High Commiſſioners in giving of it, and your Lordſhip and this Court in affirming of it, have ſhewed your ſelves, not Judges according unto law, but ſinners againſt Law, and I out of love to all your perſons, our of duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and out of obedience unto his word, am bound to tell you ſo much expreſſely by the former text. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but thou ſhalt plainely reprove him and not ſuffer ſinne upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly my Lord, this High commiſſion firſt finall ſentence of the five hundred pounds fine, and two yeares impriſonment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, is for the ſame reaſon likewiſe voide, becauſe though it mention a particular, namely my refuſall to preach the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons Uiſitation Sermon; yet that particular, that refuſall to preach that Uiſitation Sermon, is no fault, no offence, no vice, no errour, no evill, no ſinne, no tranſgreſſion of any law whatſoever, but a vertue, and an eminent vertue, even the vertue of canonicall obedience unto the 36. 49. and 52.

            <p>I now proceede to my ſecond poſition, that my refuſall to preach

the Archdeacon of Cant.

            <p>And that I may begin and goe on in this poſition, with that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I did much inſiſt in the former; certaine it is, my Lord, that here is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The two finall ſentences of the Honorable Court of High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion againſt me, may not unfitly be compared to that winde in the firſt of <hi>Iob:</hi> for as that winde ſtrooke upon the foure corners of <hi>Iobs</hi> eldeſt ſonnes houſe, and ſo did utterly ruinate it: ſo have theſe two finall ſentences ſtrooke upon the foure quarters of my eſtate, and utterly ruinated me in all, if they ſtand good. firſt they have ſtrooke me in my goods by a fine of five hundred pounds, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreated into the Exchequer, and partly paid and partly ſtall'd. Secondly, they have ſtrooke me in my liberty by foure times impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and nine full yeares and three quarters continuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Thirdly, they have ſtrooke me in my benefice by deprivation. Fourthly, they have ſtrooke me in my Miniſteriall function by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation; nay my Lord, they have ſtrooke me one ſtroke more, above and beyond all the former: they have drawne out the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſword of excommunication againſt mee, and therewith as much as in them lies, they have ſtrooke me out of this orthodox Church, cut me off from the communion of Saints, delivered me up to Satan, and adjudged my ſoule (for the ſalvation whereof our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſhed his moſt precious blood) to the eternall torments of hell fire, ſo that if ever there were, then here is wrath incomparable, implacable, inexplicable, wrath unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel'd, wrath ſuperlative.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, if herein the defendants have proceeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to the rule of Juſtice, which placeth and obſerveth a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and correſpondency betweene fault and the puniſhment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule of Gods word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.2. <hi>Secundum menſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dilicti erit plagarum modus:</hi> then it muſt needes be, that this grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And though this their Commiſſion my Lord, doth much outſtrip the firſt of the firſt of <hi>Eliz.</hi> the ſtatute whereon it is grounded: for that ſtatute extends not to every fault puniſhable by the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lawes of this land, for then it would ſwallow up all the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Yet in this caſe of mine, to ſhew mine owne innocency and the goodneſſe of my cauſe, not to make a precedent in other mens caſes, I will give the defendants free leave and liberty to exceed both the ſtatute and their Commiſſion.

whole and ſole ground and foundation and ſupportation of the whole ſentence againſt mee, and it cannot be underſtood and determined, whether my refuſall to preach the viſitation ſermon, be a breach of canonicall obedience or not, unleſſe it be firſt knowne and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, what this Canonicall obedience is: ſo that in the firſt place, my Lord, there is a neceſſity impoſed, upon mee, breiflly to preſent unto your Lordſhip what this Canonicall obedience is.</p>
            <p>The high Commiſſioners in the firſt part of their finall ſentence, as it was given in their owne Court, make Law, cuſtome, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall obedience three different and diſtinct thinges. For therein they ſay, that the Archdeacon in injoyning Huntley to preach his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſermon, hath commanded him no more, than the ſaid Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was bound to doe by law, cuſtome and by his Canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and herein by making Canonicall obedience a third and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct thing from law and cuſtome, they ſhew that they onely uſe the name of Canonicall obedience, but intend arbitrary or blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that is, a generall and univerſall obedience to all the Arch-deacons commandes, though they ſwarve both from law &amp; cuſtome, whereby they make every Arch-deacon, Biſhop and Arch-biſhop a law-maker within his owne juriſdiction, and every of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands binding and compulſive, though fortified neither by law, nor Cuſtome.</p>
            <p>But your Lordſhip, as it ſeemes, not content herewith ſteps a degree further, and makes Canonicall obedience, not onely a third and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct thing from law and cuſtome, but alſo a thing oppoſite, and contrary to law and cuſtome: for <hi>termino trinitatis</hi> 1637. when when your Lordſhip delivered your opinion in the ſpeciall verdict betweene <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Naſh,</hi> your Lordſhip ſaid, that if the Arch-deacon did owe me an 100. pounds by bond he might by vertue of my Canonicall obedience, command mee to deliver up that bond, the money, not being yet paid. Or he might command me by vertue of my Canonicall obedience, to ſend him a yoke of fat oxen, a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of good Coach-horſes, or a ſcore of fat weathers, which I am ſure is not onely beyond, but contrary to law and cuſtome, and more than either his Majeſty or any of his royall predeceſſours did ever chalenge of any freeborne ſubject, either by the oath of allegiance or oath of ſupremacy, &amp; whether your Lordſhip have altered this your opinion, or no, I know not, the high Commiſſioners I ſuppoſe, have altered theirs.</p>
            <p>For certaine it is, that the former wordes of the firſt part of their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95226:20"/>
firſt finall ſentence, as it was given in their owne Court, are altered in the defendants plea, wherein they make Canonicall obedience, not a third and diſtinct thing from law and cuſtome, as before, but a ſubordinate, relative, and a proportionable thing to law and cuſtome, by changing theſe their former wordes, law, cuſtome and his cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall obedience, into theſe, law and cuſtome according to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall obedience.</p>
            <p>And this alteration, as I ſuppoſe, proceeded from the acute and polite wit of you Maſter Juſtice <hi>Heath,</hi> at that time the Kings At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourney Generall and Commiſſioners counſell, who ſeeing that the Commiſſioners by the former wordes, did make canonicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a third and diſtinct thing from law and cuſtome, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they did under the name of canonicall obedience, chalenge ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and blind obedience to and for every Arch-deacon, Biſhop, and Arch-biſhop, that thereby they made themſelves all lawma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers within their ſeverall juriſdictions, and that ſo at once by two wordes, they gave two deadly woundes, one to his Majeſties ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame juriſdiction, who under God is the onely lawmaker with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this land, the other to the freedome and liberty of all his free-borne Subjects, who are not tyed to any lawes, but to thoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereunto they give their conſents; did prettily and wittyly invent and contrive this trimme and almoſt undiſcernable alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to cure theſe two deadly woundes: for which Sir, you did then, deſerve a better fee from the Commiſſioners, than either from his Majeſty, or from his other free-borne Subjects.</p>
            <p>But my Lord, though, Maſter Juſtice <hi>Heath</hi> hath with that one ſalve well cured thoſe two ſores, yet therein he hath not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truely expreſt and diſcover'd the nature of canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for Canonicall obedienee hath no reference to cuſtome; that's cuſtomary obedience, which is due to cuſtome, neither hath canonicall obedience relation to the laws in generall, of what kind ſoever they bee, but onely to that part and kind of law, which is called the canon law, for canonicall obedience, is ſuch obedience as the canons require, and ſuch obedience as the canons require, is canonicall obedience, they are convertible of the ſame circuit and circumference, juſt even: whatſoever is within compaſſe of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall obedience, is within the compaſſe of the canons: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is without the compaſſe of the canons, is without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of canonicall obedience, ſo that if I am bound by my cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall obedience to preach the Arch-deacons viſitation Sermon,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95226:21"/>
then I am thereunto bound by ſome canon, and if not by ſome canon,<note place="margin">Theſis tertiae probatio.</note> then not by my canonicall obedience. And that this is ſo, that canonicall obedience is ſuch obedience as the canons require, I will now endeavour to prove by foure reaſons, ſuch I hope, as ſhall ſatisfie your Lordſhip, this Court, and all men that will be ſatisfied with reaſon, and I hope, ſhall ſilence them, that will not with reaſon be ſatisfied.</p>

            <p>Here then my Lord, we have now the full extent of this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, irreligious, blind, deteſtable, damnable, devilliſh obedience in two reſpects; in reſpect of the perſons, to whom it is due, and in reſpect of the nature of the thing it ſelfe. In reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom it is due, it is to be given by every inferiour to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eccleſiaſticall ſuperiour, In reſpect of the nature of the thing it ſelfe, it is a generall and univerſall obedience to all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands whatſoever. And if we looke a little more perticularly and narrowly into it wee ſhall find, that they extend it ſometimes to thinges fond &amp; frivolous ſometimes to thinges ridiculous and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ſometimes to thinges wicked and ungodly.</p>
            <p>Firſt to thinges fond and frivolous; an inſtance hereof we have in <hi>Anſelmus</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cant.</hi> who after he was biſhop of that See, wrote to Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> to appoint him ſome man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to whoſe commands he might frame his whole life, and Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> appointed him <hi>Edmerus,</hi> and as <hi>Malmeſburien.</hi> in his firſt booke <hi>de geſtis pontificum Anglorum</hi> in the life of <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſaith, the Arch-biſhop did ſo much eſteeme the command of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus,</hi> that being in bed, he would not ſo much as riſe, nay he would not ſo much as turne himſelfe a <hi>latere ad latus,</hi> from one ſide to the other, <hi>ſine praecepto Edmeri,</hi> unleſſe <hi>Edmerus</hi> firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, and herein the Arch-biſhop ſhewed himſelfe a true patterne &amp; a lively portraiture of blind obedience.

            <p>Secondly, they extend it to thinges ridiculous and abſurd, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwold</hi> the <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Abington</hi> having ſet workemen to repaire the Abbey, charged one of his <hi>Monkes</hi> called <hi>Elſtan,</hi> to ſee their diet well prepared for them. Thereupon the Monke betakes him into the Kitchin, makes it cleane, trimmes up the veſſels, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares meat for the workmens dinner, a little before dinner, the <hi>Abbot</hi> comes into the kitchin and finding the Monke buſie in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring meate for the workemens dinner, askes him, what his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was? The Monke anſwers, that he was yeilding obedience to his command: the Abbot replied, that he gave him no ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he commanded him only to over-ſee others, not to doe thoſe thinges in his owne perſon, yet he told him, that he had done well to let his obedience outſtrippe his command, but added with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that his obedience was not yet perfect: if he would have his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience perfect indeed, the Abbot bid him thruſt his naked arme into a great ſeething pot full of meat &amp; pull out the loweſt peece of meat, that was in the pot and added, that if the ſcalding liquor did not hurt his naked arme, then his obedience was perfect indeed, <hi>Malmeſburienſis</hi> in his ſecond book <hi>de geſtis Pontificum Anglorum</hi> in the life of <hi>Elſtan,</hi> ſaith that the Monke did doe ſo, and his hand and arme received no harme and thereby as by a miracle his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was knowne to be perfect indeed.</p>

            <p>Suppoſe now my Lord, that the Pope ſhould teach the Church, and the Biſhop ſhould teach thoſe of his dioceſſe and the generall of the Jeſuites, ſhould teach thoſe of his order, not ſuch doctrine as <note n="*" place="margin">Defens. fidie. lib. 6. cap. 6. myſteria pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Ieſuit. p. 159. 160. 161.</note> Swarez teaches that it is lawfull for any man actually to depoſe, and kill a King by the Popes ſentence, Firſt excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, depoſed, and deveſted of his Subjects allegiance and fealty:</p>

And ſo my Lord, by the definition both of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall and arbitrary obedience it appeares, that Canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is ſuch obedience, as the canons require, and if if it exceed the Canons never ſo little, it is no longer Canonicall, but arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>My fourth reaſon to prove that canonical obedience, is ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience as the canons require, is in my apprehenſion of more ſtrength and force, than the three former, and it is taken from the 19. and 21. <hi>chap.</hi> of 25. of <hi>Henry.</hi> 8. which acts doe ſo limit and confine the Clergy of this land unto the canons, either made by a provinciall ſynode in this land, and confirmed by his Majeſties letters patents out of his prerogative royall or elſe made beyond ſea, and received here for lawes of this land, by the Kings ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the ſubjects free conſent and uſage, that none of the Clergy in their ſeverall juriſdictions, can goe beyond thoſe canons, without incroaching upon the ſupreme Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction of the Crowne: and therefore the Canonicall obedience approved and required in our Church by the oath of canonicall obedience, muſt of neceſſity, be ſuch obedience, as thoſe canons require, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſuperiour clergy cannot out of command require more, nor the inferiour clergy out of obedience yeild more, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Kings ſupreme Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>This will appeare moſt evidently, by the firſt of the firſt of <hi>Eliz.</hi> by the 19. and 21. chap. of the 25. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and by the oath of ſupremacy. The firſt of the 1. of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is an act to reſtore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the crowne, the ancient juriſdiction over the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall and Spirituall; then the crowne hath a juriſdiction and an ancient juriſdiction over the ſtate Eccleſiaſtical. And as the firſt of the firſt of <hi>Eliz.</hi> doth ſhew, that the crowne hath an ancient juriſdiction over the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall: ſo the 19. and 21. chap. of the 25. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. both revived in the firſt of the firſt of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as parts of that ancient juriſdiction of the crowne over the ſtate Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall doe ſhew, how farre that ancient juriſdiction of the crowne doth extend over the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall and they doe extend it, over the whole clergy, and ſubmit the whole clergy unto it, in theſe two points or reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:95226:27"/>Firſt concerning canons made beyond ſea, and then concerning canons made in this land. Concerning canons made beyond ſea, they ſo farre ſubmit the whole Clergy unto the prerogative royall and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme juriſdiction of the Crowne, that none of the clergy in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall juriſdictions, can execute or put in uſe, any ſuch forreine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons untill thoſe forreine canons are firſt received heere for lawes of this land, by the Kings ſufferance and the Subjects free conſent and cuſtome.</p>
            <p>Secondly among the canons in this land formerly made, they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate all ſuch canons, as are contrary, either to the ſupreme juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Crowne, or to the ſtatutes, cuſtomes or common lawes of this land, and approve and eſtabliſh all the reſt, untill they be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes ordered and determined by the 32. perſons there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and then concerning canons hereafter to be made in this land, they ſubmit the whole clergy unto the ſupreme juriſdiction of the crowne in theſe foure particulers.</p>
            <p>The firſt particuler is, that the Clergy cannot make any canons in their ſeverall juriſdictions, but onely when they meete in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall ſynode.</p>
            <p>The ſecond particuler is, that they cannot meete in a provinciall ſynode, untill they be firſt call'd thither by the Kings writ.</p>
            <p>The third particuler is, when the clergy are ſo met, being ſo call'd, and have made canons, that they cannot execute or put in uſe, nay they cannot promulge, or publiſh any one of theſe canons, untill thoſe canons are firſt confirmed by his Majeſties letters patents out of his ſupreme Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>And the fourth perticular is, that ſo farre they may goe, further they cannot.</p>
            <p>And then in the third place, comes the oath of ſupremacy, and that binds every Biſhop, every judge, every Clergie-man, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other perſon that hath taken that oath, to defend and maintaine all thoſe foreſaid particulers, of the prerogative royall of the crowne over the whole Clergy. For the laſt clauſe of that oath bindes every one that takes it, <note n="(a)" place="margin">The words of the oath, are to his power: but they are ſo interpreted by the right Honorable Thomas Earle of Arundell and Surrey, Earle Marſhall of England, and Generall of his Maieſties forces in his treatiſe ſtiled: Lawes and Ordinances of warre, pag 26. where he expounds the former wordes by theſe, even to the utmoſt of my power and hazard of my life.</note> 
               <hi>to the utmoſt of his power,</hi> to defend and maintaine all juriſdictions, priviledges, preheminences and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities united, or annexed to the imperiall Crowne of this realme. So that if any of them ſhall extend canonicall obedience, or the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95226:27"/>
oath of canonicall obedience, or the archidiaconall, Epiſcopall, or Archiepiſcopall juriſdiction, by vertue of canonicall obedience, or of the oath of canonicall obedience, beyond thoſe canons; he doth incroach upon the prerogative royall of the crowne, withdraw his ſubmiſſion from his Maieſty, preſume to make canons within his owne juriſdiction, violate the oath of ſupremacy, tranſgreſſe the firſt of the firſt of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the 19. of the 25. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and is therefore by that ſtatute, liable to be fined and impriſon'd at the Kings pleaſure. And ſo my Lord, I have by foure reaſons proved, that the canonicall obedience in force in our church, is ſuch obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the canons in force in our church doe require, and that all arbitrary and blind obedience is quite excluded, as a thing utterly repugnant, to the word of God, to the doctrine and diſcipline of their orthodox church, to the ſupreme juriſdiction of the crowne, and to the ancient and juſt libertie and freedome of every free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne Subject.</p>
            <p>And now my Lord by one ſyllogiſme grounded upon this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall obedience I will acquit my ſelfe and all other, incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents from preaching the viſitation Sermon, and ſhew that every viſiter, every Arch-deacon, Biſhop and Arch-biſhop is bound to preach his owne viſitation Sermon, and both theſe by vertue of canonicall obedience, ſo that theſe two wordes, which the defendants have abuſed to acquit themſelves, and condemne me, being rightly underſtood, ſhall condemne them and acquit me, and this is the ſyllogiſme.

            <p>This Canon binds the Archdeacon, to teach the Clergy and Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at his viſitation: and what muſt he teach them? why, hee muſt teach the Clergie, how to pronounce the words of the canon of Maſſe and of Baptiſme, and the Laity how to baptiſe in ſome tongue: and where were the Clergie and Laity to doe theſe things? In their owne Pariſhes, not at the viſitation. So that by this canon, the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con

is bound, to teach the Clergie and Laity at the viſitation, how to doe their owne duties, at home in their owne Pariſhes, not how to doe his duty at the viſitation. And that all this is the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons duty, it is evident by the title of the canon.

            <p>From the provinciall conſtitutions of our Archbiſhops of <hi>Cant.</hi> I proceed to the Legantine conſtitutions of this Kingdome, &amp; amongſt them I finde this canon or conſtitution made by <hi>Otho</hi> the Popes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, tit. <hi>de ſeptem ſacram. c.

            <p>This canon likewiſe bindes the Archdeacons at their viſitation, to teach the incumbents, how to carry themſelves in adminiſtring the Sacraments, which are to bee adminiſtred by them, in their owne Pariſhes, to their owne people, and not at the viſitation to ſtrangers. So that by this canon alſo, the Archdeacons are bound at their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to teach the incumbents, how to doe their owne duties at home in their owne cures, not how to doe the Archdeacons dutie at the viſitation. And which is eſpecially to be obſerved in this canon, the Archdeacons are here bound to teach the incumbents <hi>in ſingulis decanatuum ſuorum conventibus,</hi> at every meeting of the Deaneries, at every viſitation, and therefore the incumbents are not bound to teach the Archdeacons, or one another at any viſitation.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This Canon alſo bindes the Archdeacons at their viſitation, to teach the incumbents, and that frequently, carefully, and diligently, both how to leade their lives, and how to diſcharge their cures. And <hi>Iohanes de Athona</hi> in his gloſſe, ſhewes as much, &amp; withall ſhewes, how the Archdeacons did then neglect that duty, and why, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it brought no profit with it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are his very words upon the laſt text: <hi>Hic textus requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirit ſollicitudinem &amp; diligentiam in Archidiaconis. Haec tamen conſtitutio perraro ab Archidiaconis ſervatur, quia lucrum pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarium, eis inde non applicatur.</hi> And this is alſo the reaſon, my Lord, that our Archdeacons, Biſhops &amp; Archbiſhops violate theſe conſtitutions, which bindes them to preach their owne viſitation Sermons, and inforce that duty upon the incumbents, becauſe it is for their profit and eaſe ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>But if either profit or eaſe, my Lord, would have prevailed with the Archdeacon, this controverſie concerning Preaching the viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Sermon, had never beene betweene him and me: for in his plea, the fourth Article hee confeſſeth, that I offered him two or three peeces, that is, by his owne interpretation, forty ſhilling or three pounds, to procure one to preach the viſitation Sermon: ſo that if he would have Preached that Sermon himſelfe, he might have had a rich reward for his owne paines, in doing his owne worke: or if he would not, he might with part of the reward, have procured another to have preached it, &amp; ſo he might have had both profit and eaſe. But his ſpleene againſt me was ſo great, that hee would not accept of either, but preferred a moſt unjuſt warre, before a moſt juſt peace, and ſo <hi>quod peſſimorum eſt ingeniorum,</hi> hee hath rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me evill for good, and hatred for my good will.</p>
            <p>From the provinciall and legantine conſtitutions of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which are as it were an epitome, or breviat of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of rhe canon law, I proceed to the body of the canon law it ſelfe, and there in the Decretals 3. booke. 39. <hi>tit. de Cenſibus &amp;c. cap.</hi> 23. <hi>parag. porro,</hi> I find this canon or conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Porro viſitationis officium exercentes, non quaerant, quae ſuae</hi> ſunt, ſed quae ſunt Jeſu Chriſti, praedicationi &amp; exhortationi, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectioni &amp; reformationi vacando, ut fructum referant, qui non perit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:95226:31"/>The firſt thing, my Lord, to be inquired into, in this canon, is, who theſe viſitationis officium exercentes are? The former part of the canon ſhewes, that they are Arch-deacons, Biſhops, and Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: what are they to doe at the viſitation? non quaerant, quae ſua ſunt, ſed quae ſunt Jeſu Chriſti: They muſt not ſeeke for their owne thinges, that is, for procurations, but for the thinges of Jeſus Chriſt, that is, for the ſalvation of their ſoules, whom they viſite. How is that to be done? Praedicationi &amp; exhortationi, correctioni &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formationi vacando. By imploying themſelves in preaching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, there's the firſt thing; By imploying themſelves in correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; reforming, there is the ſecond thing. Where muſt theſe thinges be done? In viſitationis officium exercendo, at the viſitation. By whom? a viſitationis officium exercentibus. By them that keep the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, who are they? Arch-deacons, Biſhops, Arch-biſhops, who is now, my Lord, to preach the viſitation ſermon, The viſiter or the viſited?</p>
            <p>And here my Lord, I doe how make good my two laſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the word of God, wherein there was nothing doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but onely theſe two thinges, whether to viſite were to preach and to correct, and both they the viſiters worke at the viſitation? and both theſe appeare out of this text. For here, <hi>exercere visitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis officium, eſt praedicationi &amp; exhortationi, correctioni &amp; refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationi vacare.</hi> To viſite or keepe a viſitation, is to imploy ones ſelfe in preaching and exhorting, in correcting and reforming. So that when the canon law gives the viſiter, his procurations for viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it gives him his procurations for preaching and correcting: and when the Arch-deacons, Biſhops, and Arch-biſhops of this realme, in their proceſſe chalenge their procurations, of us the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents for viſiting us: they chalenge their procurations of us, for preaching unto us, and for correcting of us: and the reaſon hereof is, quia viſitare vel viſitationis officium exercere, nihil aliud eſt, quam praedicationi &amp; exhortationi, correctioni &amp; reformationi vacare. Becauſe to viſite or keepe a viſitation, is nothing elſe but to imploy ones ſelfe in preaching and exhorting, in correcting and reforming. And therefore my Lord, ſeeing without all queſtion, without all peradventure, it is the viſiters duety to viſite, and to viſite is to preach and to correct: therefore it is his duety to preach and correct, as this text ſhewes: and this much ſhall likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare out of my next canon, which is taken ex Sexti decretal. lib. 3. tit. 20. de cenſibus, exactionibus &amp; procurationibus cap. 1. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag. Sane. The wordes are theſe.</p>

               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:95226:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sane Archiepiſcopus viſitationis officium impenſurus, propoſito verbo Dei, quaerat de vita &amp; converſatione miniſtrantium in eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiis.</p>
            <p>This canon my Lord, juſt as the former did, doth ſhew, what it is, impendere viſitationis officium, it is proponere verbum Dei, &amp; quaerere de vita miniſtrantium in eccleſiis. To preach the word of God, and to examine the lives of the Church miniſters. And both theſe, as this canon ſhews, muſt be done by the viſiter, yea by the cheife eccleſiaſticall viſiter, by the Arch-biſhop himſelfe at his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Archiepiſcopus viſitationis officium impenſurus, propoſito ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Dei, quaerat de vita &amp; converſatione miniſtrantium in eccleſiis.</p>
            <p>Vives makes this one difference, my Lord,<note place="margin">lib. de cauſis corruptarum artium.</note> betweene a baſe wit and an ingenuous minde: that the one will ſtrive for victory, in a knowne error, the other will rather ſeeke, how true that is, which he holds, than how he may defend it, and make greater price of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than of victory. And hereupon my Lord, I hold my ſelfe bound in conſcience, to acquaint your Lordſhip with the onely exception, that the advocates for the office, have made againſt all my proofes, that ſo it may appeare, that I am not partiall in mine owne cauſe, nor wedded unto it, whether it be right or wrong: but that I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently affected, nay wholy bequeathed unto the truth, that that may take place, and get the victorie, whether it be againſt me, or for mee.</p>
            <p>When this laſt text was alleaged in my behalfe, at informations in Doctors Commons, Doctor Rives the Kings advocate, and one of the advocates for the office againſt me, a learned Lawyer and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant orator, made this exception againſt it. He granted, that by the former text, praeponere verbum dei, was the Arch-biſhops du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at his viſitation. But he added, that proponere verbum dei, did not bind the Arch-biſhop to preach the word of God at his viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely to lay the word of God before him at his viſitation: as if the words of the text had beene, Praepoſito verbo Dei, and not propoſito verbo dei.</p>
            <p>Dulhard vives his ſchoole-maſter was of opinion, that the worſt Grammarian would make the beſt logician: and it ſeemes,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> that Doctor Rives is of Dulhards opinion and thinkes to prove himſelfe a great canoniſt, by ſhewing himſelfe a weake grammarian, by taking pro or prae, or by confounding pro with prae. But this my Lord, is not expoſitio or interpretatio, but nugatio, nay corruptio &amp; depravatio textus: or if it be an interpretation, it is ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95226:32"/>
as gave occaſion to this old proverbe, mala gloſſa corrumpit textum. And as at that time, I entreated Doctor Rives to compare his gloſſe, with the approved gloſſe upon theſe words, which I ſuppoſe ſatisfied him at that time, I am ſure it made him ſilent: ſo I deſire your Lordſhip to obſerve the difference betweene Docter Rives his gloſſe, and the ordinary gloſſe, and to judge which comes neereſt the text.</p>
            <p>The ordinary gloſſe upon theſe former wordes, <hi>Sane Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopus viſitationis officium impenſurus, propoſito verbo Dei. quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat de vita &amp; converſatione miniſtrantium in eccleſiis,</hi> makes this queſtion, <hi>Hic quaeritur, quid primo debet facere Archiepiſcopus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitans?</hi> It gives this anſwer, <hi>Reſpondetur, quod primo debet praedicare verbum dei, deinde debet inquirere, de vita &amp; moribus habitanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ibidem vid. clericorum &amp; laicorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proponere verbum dei then, not onely by its owne grammaticall ſignification, but alſo by the gloſſes approved interpretation, is prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare verbum dei, to preach the word of God: &amp; thereunto the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chbiſhop himſelfe, the cheife viſiter, under the King, is tied, &amp; that ex debito, ex officio, out of debt &amp; duety. Nay it is his primum debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, his primum officium: his ſecond debt &amp; duety at the viſitation, is to correct, and reforme: and both theſe this laſt gloſſe doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſhew. Archiepiſcopus viſitans debet, primo debet predicare verbum dei, deinde deber inquirere, de vita &amp; moribus ibidem habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantium vid. clericorum &amp; laicorum. So that both by this laſt text &amp; gloſſe, Archiepiſcopus viſitans tenetur, tenetur ex debito, tenetur ex officio, praedicare, primo praedicare verbum dei, ſecundo corrigere &amp; reformare.</p>
            <p>And now my Lord having prov'd it the Archbiſhops, the cheife Eccleſiaſticall viſiters, debt and duty, which he is to pay and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the Clergy and Laity at his viſitation, nay his prime debt and duty, in the firſt place to preach his owne viſitation Sermon, I may eaſily by an argument, drawne a <hi>majore ad minorem,</hi> a <hi>ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riore ad inferiorem,</hi> prove it the duty of every inferiour viſiter, of every Biſhop, and Archdeacon, to preach his owne viſitation Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; for quod valet in majore, valebit etiam in minore. But I ſtand not in neede of theſe topicall and analogicall arguments. The laſt paragraph of that chapter, the paragraph Hanc autem, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as much of every Biſhop, and Archdeacon, at their viſitation, as is by the former paragraph, the paragraph Sane, enjoyned the Arch-biſhop at his viſitation.</p>

For the firſt canon of the ſecond Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charen Councell contained in the chapter placuit, binds every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to goe over his whole dioceſſe parochiatim, and in every pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh to teach, both clergy and laity: The clergy, how to doe their owne dueties in their owne Churches: and the laity, how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Articles of the Chriſtian faith, and how to lead a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and then that canon concludes. <hi>Et sic poſtea Epiſcopus de il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ecclesia proficiſcatur ad aliam.</hi>

            <p>And if any Biſhop eitheir through multitude of buſineſſe, or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſickneſſe, or want of knowledge, or through other occaſions, cannot in his owne perſon, preach the word of God Parochiatim through his whole diaeceſſe: Then the other canon, the tenth canon of the ſecond Lateran Councell binds him, <hi>aſſumere viros idoneos, potentes opere &amp; ſermone, qui plebes ſibi commiſſas, vice ipsius (cum ipſe per ſe idem nequeat) ſollicite visitantes, verbo aedificent &amp; exemplo.</hi> To take unto himſelfe able men powerfull in deed and word, who carefully viſiting the people committed to him, may in his ſteed, when he himſelfe cannot, edifie them by word and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample And it ties the Biſhop to give them competent allowance. <hi>Quibus ipſe cum indiguerint, congrue neceſſaria miniſtret,</hi> and it ſhewes, that the Biſhop is bound ſo to doe, by the law of naturall equity, becauſe they are his <hi>coadintors &amp; cooperators, non ſolumin praedicationis officio, verum etiam in audiendis confeſſonibus &amp; panitentiis iniungendis, ac caeteris peragendis, quae ad ſalutem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent animarum,</hi> and it concludes, <hi>ſi quis hoc neglexerit adimplere diſtrictae ſubiaceat ultioni.</hi> If any Biſhop ſhall not preach the word, heare confeſſiones, injoyne penance Parochiatim, through his whole diaeceſſe, either in his owne perſon, or elſe ſubſtitute others under him, to doe ſo for him, and give them a good allowance for it, he is ſeverely to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>And thus my Lord, whereas our Archdeacons, Biſhops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, make it the incumbents duty, out of canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to Preach the viſiters viſitation Sermon: I have

proved, that canonicall obedience is ſuch obedience as the canons require, and that the canons bind every viſiter, every Archdeacon, Biſhop, and Archbiſhop, to preach his owne viſitation Sermon, at the publicke meeting of the Deaneries, &amp; alſo in his owne perſon, or by deputies, to preach parochiatim in every incumbents cure, through his whole Dioceſſe, and I will now conclude this firſt particular, with the repetition of the firſt part of my former ſyllogiſme.

            <p>And in the firſt place, my Lord, I muſt put a difference betweene the auntient and moderne canons. The auntient canons gave pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to every Presbyter, that had cure of ſoules, to preach the word, and to doe all other offices of his calling in his owne cure. In the fift booke of <hi>Lyndewodes</hi> Provinciall tit. <hi>de Haereticis. cap. Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſsime.

            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:95226:37"/>And to that purpoſe in the firſt booke of <hi>Lyndewodes</hi> Provinciall tit. <hi>De officio Archipresbyteri, cap.

            <p>But our moderne canons, our canons made in King <hi>Iames</hi> his raigne, hath altered this point and permits not any incumbent to Preach or expound any Scripure no not in his owne cure, untill hee be firſt made a Licenſed Preacher: ſo that our Church according to thoſe canons, hath two ſorts of incumbents, ſome that are licenſed <note n="(g)" place="margin">Saint Chryſoſt. on 1.

And at the time of his licenſing, the Biſhop that licenceth him, is to ſee him ſubſcribe to the three Articles for the conformity of Religion, extant in the 36. canon. Otherwiſe the Biſhop that licenſeth him, is to be ſuſpended for a tweluemoneth, by the 36. canon: And ſuch a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe is qualification to hold two benefices, by the 41. canon: And he that is thus licenſed, is bound to preach in his owne cure once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sunday only, by the 45. canon. He that is not thus licenſed, is no licenſed preacher, &amp; is forbidden to preach, or expound any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his owne cure or elſewhere, by the 36. 49. &amp; 52. Canon.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, can the Archdeacon, or any other Prelate by canonicall obedience, command a licenced preacher to preach either twice a ſunday in his owne cure, or once in the weeke daies, either in his owne cure, or at the viſitation, or elſewhere? He cannot by canonicall obedience, which is ſuch obedience as the canons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, command him beyond the Canons. If he doe, he brings in uncanonicall, praetercanonicall, or ultracanonicall obedience, the firſt part or kinde of Arbitrary or blinde obedience, and therein,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95226:37"/>
he goes contrary to the nineteenth of the 25. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. which in ſubmiſſion to the Kings ſupreame Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the whole Clergie of this Land, to the Canons of this land, he incrocheth upon the royall prerogative of the Crowne, hee with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drawes his ſubmiſſion from his Majeſtie, he preſumes to make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons within his owne juriſdiction, &amp; for that by the former ſtatute being convict therfore, he is liable to be fin'd and impriſon'd at the Kings pleaſure. And beſide both he, and they that obey him, and they that aſſiſt him, and they that pleade or argue for him, and they that give ſentence or judgement with him, doe all violate the oath of ſupremacy: for by that oath they are all bound to the utmoſt of their power to aſſiſt &amp; defend all juriſdictions of the Crowne, and they to the utmoſt of their power doe overthrow and betray the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient juriſdiction of the crowne over the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
            <p>But this is not my caſe, my Lord, for I am not a licenced Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, neither was I, when this controverſie firſt began: and the Defendants confeſſe ſo much in their plea, the fift Article: neither could I ſince procure a licence of them, though I ſued unto them twice for it, and they both in their Articles and ſentence, extant in their plea, confeſſe me to be ſufficiently qualified for a licenſed prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. And therefore I then was, and am now forbidden to preach or expound any Scripture in mine owne cure, or elſewhere, by the 36. 49. and 52. canons.</p>
            <p>Now theſe Canons my Lord were made by a provinciall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, call'd together by the Kings writ, and they were afterwards confirmed by his Majeſties Letters Patents, out of his prerogative royall. His Majeſtie therein ſtraightly chargeth, all his loving ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of both provinces, to keepe and obſerve all thoſe Canons, in every point, wherein they doe, or may concerne every, or any of them: and hee doth likewiſe charge all Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and all others, that exerciſe any Eccleſiaſticall authority within this Realme, to ſee and procure that all within their juriſdictions, doe obſerve and keepe them in the former manner. So that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty doth charge mee, being no licenſed preacher, to keepe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the former canons, which forbid me to preach in mine owne cure, or elſewhere: and doth likewiſe charge the Arch-deacon, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Arch-biſhop of Canterbury to ſee and procure, that I doe obſerve them. And to the intent that both clergy and laity may the better obſerve them, his Majeſty chargeth all incumbents, to read them publickely, in their owne Churches, to their owne people, once every yeere.</p>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95226:38"/>Now can the Arch-deacon, or any other prelate, by canonicall obedience command me to preach, contrary to theſe canons?

For he that ſaies, obey them, which have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſoules. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. commands obedience, and expreſſely aſcribes rule to the Church. And this is not onely a paſtorall power, to teach and direct, but a praetorian alſo, to correct and cenſure too, where errors or crimes are againſt points fundamentall or of great conſequence elſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would not have given the rule for Excommunication. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.

            <p>And this my Lord is evident by the very words of our Saviour, wherein he gives power to his Apoſtles to excommunicate. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. <hi>Whoſe ſoever ſinnes yee remit, they are remitted, and whoſeſoever ſinnes ye retaine they are retained:</hi> And the retaining of the ſinnes of an impenitent ſinner, is the excommunicating, and caſting him out of the Church, for his ſinnes, and for his impenitency.</p>
            <p>Why then my Lord, a man cannot bee juſtly excommunicated, except it bee for ſome ſinne: and then our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt cannot juſtly be excommunicated. For he did no ſinne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any guile found in his mouth. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. and if our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt cannot be juſtly excommunicated, neither can any man be juſtly excommunicated, for his Communion with, or his obedience to our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>And this is evident, my Lord firſt in the <hi>Iewes. Iohn</hi> 9. who by excommunicating the man borne blind, and cur'd by Chriſt, for profeſſing and defending Chriſt, did not excommunicate or ſeperate him from Chriſt: (for Chriſt did immediately after that, entertaine him moſt gratiouſly) but did excommunicate and ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves both from him and Chriſt, united by that excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſecondly, in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> who by Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing the reformed Churches, for divers divine trueths, wherein they hold communion with Jeſus Chriſt, have thereby united Chriſt, and the reformed Churches more ſtrongely and neerely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and have made a ſeparation onely, betweene that Councell and all that hold with it, on the one ſide, and Jeſus Chriſt and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches thereby united on the otherſide.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe my Lord, the high commiſſioners by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95226:42"/>
me, for my obedience to Jeſus Chriſt, to this Orthodox Church, to the Kings Majeſty to the high Court of Parliament, and to a provinciall ſynode, have thereby indeed united mee, and all theſe more neerely together, and have made a ſeparation onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themſelves on the one ſide, and me and all the former, united by that excommunication on the other ſide. And as among the high Commiſſioners, my Lord, ſome are oftner or ſeldomer excommunicate, according as they have had their fingers, oftner or ſeldomer in my puniſhments: ſo they that have beene actors and parties in all my ſix puniſhments, are excommunicate full 13. times. And whilſt they ſtand and continue thus excommunicate, without either pleading the Kings pardon, or performing publicke penance, I for my part ſhall account them fitter for Amſterdam, and for Rome, than for this orthodox Church of England, out of which they have juſtly caſt themſelves by excommonicating me unjuſtly, for my communion therewith, and for my obedience thereto.</p>
            <p>And this much my Lord, concerning the principalls:<note place="margin">The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants 3.

The firſt is taken from law, the ſecond from cuſtome, and the third from a title, given to the Archdeacon in the canon law, and alleaged in the defendants plea, the third Article, namely becauſe the Archdeacon is oculus epiſcopi, and therefore may enjoyne the incumbents within his Archdeaconry, to preach his viſitation ſermon: that thereby he may ſee, and learne, and know their ſufficiency. I will begin with the Argument taken from Law. The law is the fift commandement of the decalogue: Honour thy father and thy mother: and from theſe wordes a right learned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner in giving the firſt part of the firſt finall ſentence againſt me argued thus;<note place="margin">The firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</note>
            </p>
            <p>You Sir (ſaith he to me) will doe nothing, but what you are bound to doe by law, will you? and doth not the law bind you to preach the Arch-deacons viſitation ſermon? doth not the fift Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement bind you to honour your Father? and is not the Arch-deacon your ſpirituall father, and are not you his ſpirituall ſonne? and hath not a ſpirituall father power by the fift Commandement to command his ſpirituall ſonne any ſpirituall worke? and is not a ſpirituall ſonne bound by the ſame commandement, to obey the ſpirituall command of his ſpirituall father, in doing the ſpirituall work commanded by him? Ergo you Sir are bound by the fift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, to doe this ſpirituall worke, to preach the Arch-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons viſitation ſermon at the Archdeacons command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:95226:43"/>This was the argument my Lord, Socratically drawne from law: and this argument in and of it ſelfe, is very weake and feeble, all the ſtrength of it, depends upon the authority and credit of the argumentator: and therefore unleſſe I will be injurious to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe and to the cauſe of my adverſaries, I muſt make known the Authour of this Argument, that ſo the ſtrength and validity thereof may the more appeare.</p>
            <p>It was the right worthy, and right worſhipfull Sir <hi>Henry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, vir cum cura dicendus,</hi> a man not to be mentioned without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular reverence.

            <p>But my Lord, though the Authour of this Argument was ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, yet if we examine the argument it ſelfe, we ſhall finde it very weake and feeble, and being reduced into a ſyllogiſme, it runnes thus:
  <list type="syllogism">

            <p>This ſyllogiſme my Lord, in reſpect of the forme is good, and all the doubt is concerning the matter of the major or firſt propoſition. If that be true,, then the concluſion is true, if that be falſe, then the concluſion will faile. And firſt my Lord, I will confute the major or firſt propoſition (wherein the whole ſtrength of the argument lies) by granting it, and by ſhewing what a multitude of errors ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, and inconveniencies, will follow and flow from it. The major or firſt propoſition is this:</p>
            <p>By the fifth Commandement every ſpirituall father may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his ſpirituall ſonne any ſpirituall worke, and by the ſame commandement every ſpirituall ſonne is bound to obey the ſpirituall command of his ſpirituall father, in doing the ſpirituall worke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him.</p>

And beſides, he may command me to preach for him alwaies at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend, at his Donative, at his two benefices, and ſo he ſhall take his eaſe, and have all the gaines, and I take all the paines and diſcharge his cures and neglect mine owne.

The foure extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and temporary are theſe; To bee ſent immediately by Chriſt, to have infallibility of judgement, a power to worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and to bee ſent over the whole world.

And ſo

every Pariſh Prieſt, Archdeacon, Biſhop, and Archbiſhop, ſhall have not onely Epiſcopall and Archepiſcopall authority by his bare word, to make licenſed preachers over all <hi>England,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Canons, but alſo Apoſtolicall power, to ſend li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Preachers over the whole world: which is the uſurpation and preſumption, which the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> challengeth to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of all the Biſhops, Archbiſhops, and Churches of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to the diminiſhing of the ſupreame juriſdiction of all the temporall Princes through the world.</p>
            <p>Whence my Lord, will ariſe an intollerable confuſion of all the foreſaid functions: and every lay man, by the Command of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſuperiour, ſhall be enabled to excommunicate any man, even Kings and Princes, and then ſurely every Clergie man may doe as much, and then neither Clergie nor Laity can juſtly except aginſt Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> for excommunicating Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> nor againſt <hi>Felton,</hi> for ſetting up that excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Biſhops of <hi>Londons</hi> gates.

               <pb facs="tcp:95226:49"/>So I may as truly obſerve againſt his Grace, the High-Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, your Lordſhip, this Court, the Barons of the Exchequer, and the Lords of the Counſell, that juſtice towards the King, and juſtice towards God, are both joyned together by our Saviour in one verſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. becauſe he that out of conſcience, is juſt towards one, will be juſt towards both: and he that is wittingly unjuſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one, will eaſily be unjuſt towards both.</p>

the Archdeacon is the incumbents ſpirituall father, and the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents are the Archdeacons ſpirituall ſonnes; and by the fift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, the ſpirituall ſonne is to teach the ſpirituall father, and not the ſpirituall father his ſpirituall ſonnes: and therefore by the fift commandement the incumbents, and not the Archdeacon are to Preach the Archdeacons viſitation Sermon.</p>

            <p>And therefore my Lord, ſeeing Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> by his chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall interpretation will extract the contrary out of the fift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, &amp; make it every ſpirituall ſonnes duty to teach his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall father, the Pariſhioners duty to teach the incumbents, the incumbents duty to teach the Archdeacon, the Archdeacons duty to teach the Biſhop, the Biſhops duty, to teach the Archbiſhop, the Archbiſhops duty, to teach the Patriarches the Patriarches duty to teach the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles duty to teach Chriſt, and Chriſts duty to teach God: I thinke I may truly ſay, that Sir <hi>Henry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> hath found out that in this commandement, which God never put into it, juſt as <hi>Anah</hi> found out Mules in the wilderneſſe, as hee kept his father <hi>Zibeons</hi> Aſſes. <hi>Gen.</hi> 36. the one found out a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which God never made; the other a ſence, which God never intended.

            <p>The Defendants ſecond Argument, my Lord, is taken from cuſtome: they ſay it is the cuſtome, that the Incumbents ſhould preach the Arch-deacons Viſitation Sermon.

               <hi>Canterbury,</hi> they brought up ten or twelve Proceſſes to prove this cuſtome. But after they had brought them up, they durſt not ſo much as ſhew them, either at informations, or at the finall hearing of the Cauſe.

               <hi>Dabo ex ſuppoſito, quod non dabo ex animo.</hi> Let it then be cuſtome, what followes? why this; Then the Cauſe is a civill Eccleſiaſticall Cauſe, and not a criminall Cauſe, and then it is and hath been all this while <hi>coram non judice,</hi> and ſo the ſentence and whole proceedings of the Commiſſioners are utterly voyd.</p>

               <note place="margin">Concesſio 2. &amp; retortio in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarios.</note>Secondly, be it cuſtome, then the Arch-deacon hath broken the cuſtome and not I; for the Commiſſioners in the firſt part of their firſt finall ſentence extant in their Plea, made an Order, that I upon the Arch-deacons Mandate, and a competent warning thereby to me given, ſhould preach a Sermon at the Arch-deacons next Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now this Order is the cuſtome, or elſe it is not. If this Order be not the cuſtome, then I being bound to obſerve the cuſtome, am not bound to obſerve this order: or elſe being bound to obſerve this order, I am not bound to obſerve the cuſtome. Let them chuſe which they will, they are faulty in either. If this Order be the cuſtome, then the Arch-deacon, and not I hath broken both Order, and cuſtome; becauſe he only ſent an Apparitor with a poſtſcript private letter, or meſſage to warne me to preach his Viſitation Sermon; but ſent no mandate, or proceſſe, or publike inſtrument for that purpoſe, out of his Court by his Apparitor, as he ſhould have done, both by the Order and cuſtome; and both theſe the Defendants confeſſe in their Plea, and they ſhall be both ſhewed againſt them at large, in my anſwer to to the fourth acceſſory.</p>

And then at begining of this controverſie, this pretended cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, being but of 23. years ſtanding, could not be cuſtome accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former rule; ſeeing at the begining of this controverſie, there were divers men then living, who could remember the contrary.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Confutatio. </seg>3</label> But in the fift place, my Lord, it cannot be cuſtome: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contrary to the Word of God, as appears by my three firſt arguments. Secondly, becauſe it is contrary to the whole courſe and tenour of the Canon Law; in the body of the Canon Law, in <hi>Lyndewodes</hi> provinciall, in the Legantine Conſtitutions of <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Othobon,</hi> and in our laſt Canons, all which I have formerly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And laſtly, becauſe it is contrary to naturall equitie, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra naturalem aequitatem nulla valet conſuetudo etiamſi omnes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines de mundo aliter facerent,</hi> ſaith the Canon Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:95226:52"/>Now this rule of naturall equity, is deliver'd by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 10, 7. <hi>The labourer is worthy of his hire,</hi> which is true, <hi>e converſo,</hi> he that hath the hire, is bound to performe the labour. And this labourer is the Viſiter, and his labour is to Viſit, that is to preach, and to correct, and his hire for that labour, is Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and all theſe I have formerly proved. It is then contrary to naturall equitie, for us to detain Procurations from the Viſiter, when he Viſits us, that is preacheth unto us, and correcteth us. It is likewiſe contrary to naturall equity, for the Viſiter to require Procurations, when he doth not Uiſit, that is preach and correct. It is moſt apparently contrary to naturall equitie, for the Viſiter to require Procurations of the Incumbents for Viſiting them. that is for preaching unto them, and for correcting them, and yet to impoſe upon them the Viſitation Sermon, the ſpeciall part of that labour, for which the Viſiter requireth and receiveth his Procurations of the Incumbents. And upon this ground the Canon Law affirms, <hi>quod in procuratione ratione viſitationis debita, non currit praeſcriptio.</hi> And then there can be no cuſtome to binde the Incumbents, either to pay Procurations, or to preach the Viſitation Sermon.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> There is one weake argument my Lord, yet remaining, and that's this. The Arch-deacon is <hi>tanquam oculus Epiſcopi;</hi> and therefore may enjoyn the Miniſters within his juriſdiction to preach his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation Sermon, that thereby he may ſee, and learn, and know their ſufficiency.</p>
            <p>I do confeſſe, my Lord, that in the Canon Law, the Arch-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con is called <hi>oculus Epiſcopi,</hi> and which is more, <hi>vicarius Epiſcopi.</hi> And I have often wondred, why they ſhould ſo much preſſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and wholly paſſe over the latter; and the reaſon as I conceive, is this: The latter, gives not only ſome part of Epiſcopall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the Arch-deacon, but alſo bindes him to performe ſome part of Epiſcopall duty. Now the Biſhops duty, he being Rector, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Diaeceſis,</hi> and having <hi>curam animarum</hi> is to Viſit his Diaeceſſe, and to preach to, and inſtruct all there, and to reforme thoſe that are faulty, and this much the name of Vicar impoſeth upon the Arch-deacon; for <hi>Vicarius tenetur implere vicem ejus, cujus eſt Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> And therefore Maſter Arch-deacon doth willingly omit this title, becauſe this doth binde him as well to preach and correct at his Viſitation, as give him power to hold a Viſitation under the Biſhop. He only inſiſts upon this title of <hi>oculus Epiſcopi,</hi> as if he were tied not to preach himſelfe, but only to ſee the Incumbents
<pb facs="tcp:95226:52"/>
preach, and that not in their pariſhes, at their own Cures, but at the Viſitation, his Cure.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Confutatio. </seg>
               </label> But what force the former title hath, the Canon law which gives it him, will beſt ſhew. It was firſt given to the Deacons, and then to the Arch-deacons. <hi>Decreti</hi> 1. <hi>parte. Diſt.</hi> 93. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. we have theſe words, <hi>Diaconi Eccleſiae, tanquam oculi ſunt Epiſcopi, ober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes &amp; circum-luſtrantes cum verecundia actus totius Eccleſiae, &amp; perſcrutantes diligentius, ſi quem videant vicinum praecipitio, &amp; proximum eſſe peccato:</hi> and the gloſſe upon that Text notes, <hi>quod loco Diaconorum ſucceſſerunt Archidiaconi, qui dicuntur occuli Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi, quia perluſtrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now could the Deacons, becauſe they were <hi>oculi Epiſcopi,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the Presbyters to preach a Viſitation Sermon? They could not, and if they could not; neither can Maſter Arch-deacon do it, by vertue of that title which was theirs, before it was his. All that was thereby required of them, was to go about, &amp; to obſerve with modeſty, what was done in the whole Church, and to marke and view diligently, if any man ran head-long into ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to certifie the Biſhop thereof; and in this ſence, let the Arch-deacon be <hi>oculus Epiſcopi</hi> in Gods name, and be as vigilant to prevent ſin, and to recover ſinners, as may be. But this gives him no power to command the Incumbents to preach at his Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but only to obſerve how they lead their lives, and how they diſcharge their Cures; and if he finde them defective in either, then <hi>tanquam oculus Epiſcopi</hi> to inform the Biſhop thereof.</p>
            <p>And how ever, my Lord, it cannot be denied; but that the Arch-deacon by the abuſe of this title of <hi>oculus Epiſcopi;</hi> that is, by wincking at the faults of ſome Incumbents, and by prying into, and aggravating the faults of others; hath drawn divers Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents to preach his Viſitation Sermon, which elſe would not: yet there is no ſuch power or vertue in the title it ſelfe, but rather the contrary, as will appeare out of the Decretalls, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 23. <hi>De officio Archidiaconi, cap.</hi> 7. which ſets downe the ſeverall reſpects, in which the Arch-deacon is called <hi>oculus Epiſcopi.</hi> I will alleage the words at large.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oculus Epiſcopi Archidiaconus appellatur, ut loco Epiſcopi per Epiſcopatum proſpiciens, quae corrigenda viderit, corrigat &amp; emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det. &amp; inſtitutio corporalis tam ſuper beneficiis quam etiam digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus, ad ipſum debeat pertinere.

beneficiorum credimus obſervandum; Vt qui beneficiis Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis praeficiendi fuerint, a ſuo prius examinentur Archidiacono, &amp; per ipſum poſt Epiſcopo praeſententur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this text, my Lord, the Arch-deacon is called <hi>oculus Epiſcopi,</hi> in theſe three reſpects. Firſt, becauſe in the Biſhops ſtead, he is to looke over the whole Diaeceſſe, and to correct and reforme ſuch things, as are out of order, or elſe to inform the Biſhop thereof. Secondly, becauſe he is to examine the Clergie at their Ordination, and according to their deſerts; either to turn them backe, or elſe to preſent them to the Biſhop: and this much likewiſe is given to the Arch-deacons in our Church, as appears by the booke of ordering Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons. And thirdly, becauſe the Arch-deacon is to do the like at the Collation of Benefices; that is, before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop admits and Inſtitutes into Benefices, and then to induct thoſe, whom the Biſhop upon his commendation admits and Inſtitutes.</p>
            <p>All the power then, that the Archdeacon hath by being <hi>oculus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi,</hi> is either a generall power to obſerve and reform all faults o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole Diaeceſſe, or to inform the Biſhop thereof; or elſe a more eſpeciall power to examine the Clergie at their Ordination and Inſtitution, but not to enjoyne them then and there to preach. And ſeeing the Arch-deacon at Ordination and Inſtitution, can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſufficiencie of the Clergie by examination, without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them preach; why may he not by the ſame courſe, do the like at the Viſitation? Nay, why ſhould he at the Viſitation, go about by examination, to queſtion the ſufficiency of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents, whoſe ſufficiency he had before diſcover'd and approv'd, both at their Ordination and Inſtitution? How ever, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, my Lord, that the Arch-deacon by that Text and title, hath no more power at the Viſitation, than he had at Ordination and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: And therefore ſeeing at theſe latter, he hath by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Text and title, a power only to examine the Clergie, that's the utmoſt that he can challenge at the former, as <hi>oculus Epiſcopi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſee my Lord the Art and wiſedome of Maſter Archdeacon, or rather his deceit and ſubtilty in interpreting the former text. To examine the incumbents at his viſitation, which by the former text and title he may doe, would be to his trouble; to command them then and there to preach, which by the former text and title he may not doe, would be for his profit and eaſe: therefore in the foreſaid Text, by a verball tranſmutation, he would convert exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into preaching, and Ordination and Inſtitution into Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95226:53"/>
And ſo where the Canon Law ſaith, that he is to examine us at our Ordination and Inſtitution; he would make it ſay, that we are to preach to him and for him at his Viſitation: where the Law ſaith, that this eye is to looke into the Clergie by examination at their Ordination and Inſtitution, that is, before their preferment: He would make it ſay, that this eye is to looke into them after their preferment, by hearing them preach at the Viſitation; as if their preferment were to go before their tryall and not their tryall before their preferment.</p>
            <p>But my Lord, this is not <hi>oculum agere,</hi> to perform the part of an eye; or if it be, it is of a weak and dimme ſighted eye, which takes one thing for another, like the blinde man in the Goſpel, who in the begining of his cure, <hi>ſaw men walke like trees, Marke</hi> 8. For I can never think that eye, whoſe ſo ever it be, quick-ſighted, nor fit to be <hi>oculus Epiſcopi,</hi> which cannot diſcern examination from preaching, and Ordination and Inſtitution from Viſitation.</p>
            <p>And ſo my Lord, for a farwell to the Principals; I leave it to your Lordſhip, and the Court to conſider whether the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners were not invited by the preſumption of their own ſtrength, and of my weakneſſe, to uſe the foreſaid arguments, which upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination make quite againſt them: Or whether they were not at that time like men in danger of drowning, who being taught by nature to do their beſt to ſave themſelves, and yet being deprived of the right uſe of their ſences, do divers times ſeeke helpe, and lay hold on things that hurt them, and keepe them under water, and thereby drown themſelves the ſooner.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning the principalls,<note place="margin">The acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> and the Defendants three Arguments. I now proceed to the acceſſories. And here my Lord, ſeeing the Defendants have falſified the Law in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, your Lordſhip, and the Court are not to give credit unto them, concerning the acceſſories: ſeeing in the principalls they have called my obedienc to the Word of God, to the Articles Statutes, Canons, to his Maieſties Letters Patents, royall Prerogative, and oath of Supreamacie (which are all extant to the view of the world) a breach of Canonicall obedience, a principall or eſpeciall fault, a grievous and enormous crime; they are not according to their own Law, to be credited concerning any fact, they charge me within the acceſſories; for <hi>qui ſemel eſt malus ſemper praeſumitur malus in eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem genere mali</hi> and <hi>qui ſemel veritatis &amp; verecundiae limites tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilierit, cum oportet eſſe gnaniter impudentem, nec ei deinceps

niſi paenitenti, culpani confitenti, &amp; veniam expetenti, eſt in aliqua credendum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Lord, though according to theſe axioms, the defendants are not to be credited in any of the acceſſories, becauſe they have falſified the Law in the principalls. Yet I labour not to impeach their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in all, but in one only circumſtance, which runs through the three firſt acceſſories, which is groſly and palpably falſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Records of their own Court. For whereas in the firſt acceſſorie, they charge me, that I came unſent for, or uncall'd for, to Maſter Arch-deacon aforeſaid he being in his Viſitation among the Clergie; and ſitting there to heare Cauſes: and in the ſecond acceſſorie, that I did then and there charge the ſaid Arch-deacon of falſhood and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>juſtice: and in the third acceſſorie, that I did at the ſame time and place lay down an hundred pounds in gold upon the table, and offered to lay wagers with him the ſaid Arch-deacon, that he had done me wrong, or the like in effect. I confeſſe I did theſe three, but not at the ſame time and place, not whil'ſt Maſter Arch-deacon ſate in his Viſitation to heare Cauſes; but afterwards, as will appear by theſe three circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The Viſitation is alwaies kept in Saint <hi>Margarets</hi> Church in <hi>Canterburie;</hi> this was in the parlour of the Checker Inne in <hi>Cant.</hi> The Viſitation is alwaies begun, continued and ended in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone before dinner; this was in the after-nooneafter dinner. At the Viſitation are preſent both Clergie, and Laity, the Miniſters, and the Churchwardens; here were preſent the Clergie only; and the Defendants themſelves in their Plea mention only the Clergie: the Arch-deacon, ſay they, being in his Viſitation among the Clergie, not amongſt the Laity. And it is evident by the Records of their own Court, and by the teſtimony of their own witneſſes, Dr. <hi>Say,</hi> and <hi>Henry Ienkins</hi> that theſe things were ſaid and done in the Checker Inne in <hi>Canterburie</hi> after dinner and not in Saint <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garets</hi> Church at the Viſitation. And it appeares likewiſe by the ſubmiſſion enjoyned me; for by their own Order that ſubmiſſion was to be uttered before the Clergie in the dining roome before dinner, and not in Saint <hi>Margarets</hi> Church, at the Viſitation. And beſide I here make oath in truth in juſtice and in judgement, that theſe three acceſſories were ſaid and done, not in Saint <hi>Margarets</hi> Church at the Viſitation, but in the parlour of the Checker Inne in <hi>Canterburie,</hi> where I never yet knew any Viſitation kept by Maſter Arch-deacon.</p>

For I have before ſhewed, how under the name of Canonicall obedience, he would have brought in arbitrary and blinde obedience, and the worſt part or kind therof; not that only which is uncanonicall pretercanonicall, or ultracanonicall, but that alſo which is anticanonicall, or contracano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall. A thing repugnant to the Word of God, to the doctrine and diſcipline of this orthodox Church, to the Prerogative royall of the Crown, and to the freedome and liberty of every free-born Subject. Is not this falſhood, wrong, and injuſtice? I have before ſhewed, how he hath advanced his apocryphall, uncanonicall, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canonical, antidiplomatical, antiprerogative antiſuprematicall poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, private letter and meſſage, above the Canons of this Church, his Majeſties Letters Patents, and royall Prerogative; above a royall Prerogative inveſted in the Crowne by God himſelfe; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Article, by Statute, by Canon, nay, above a royall Prerogative, which he and I by the oath of ſupremacy, are both bound to the utmoſt of our power to defend and maintain; and yer he hath violated it, and would have made me have violated it, as he hath made many others. Is not this falſhood, wrong, and injuſtice?</p>
            <p>Yea but though it be; yet peradventure I might not tell him ſo much. Yes, my Lord, I was bound to tell him of it by the Word of God, by the Canon Law, by the law of Nature, and by the oath of Supremacy. The Word of God, <hi>Levit,</hi> 19.17. ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but thou ſhalt plainly reprove him, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> So did I.

And the oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie bindes me to the utmoſt of my power; to defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all juriſdictions of the Crown; and therefore this among the reſt, that none of the Clergie in their ſeverall juriſdictions can go beyond, much leſſe contrary to the Canons without incroaching upon the Prerogative royall, and ſupreame Juriſdiction of the Crowne.</p>

And for that purpoſe I have made choice rather to be fin'd, impriſon'd, depriv'd, degraded, and excommunicated by the High-Commiſſioners, and to endure thoſe tedious delaies, and thoſe manifold diſgraces, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and injuries in this Court, than by betraying the Kings ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie to the Arch-deacons uſurpation, with the High-Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, this Court, the Barons of the Exchequer, and the Lords of the Counſell, to violate that oath, and ſo to commit perjury; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a thing moſt acceptable in Gods ſight, to endure the greateſt puniſhments for to avoid the leaſt ſin, much more for to avoyd the greateſt ſin; ſo that ſet aſide this one untrue circumſtance, there is nothing at all culpable in theſe three firſt acceſſories.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The manner of ſpeaking and of laying the wager.</note>And though the Defendants ſay, that I did ſpeake very malepert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and irreverently to Maſter Arch-deacon, and offered to lay the wager with him in a very arrogant and irreſpective maner; yet ſeeing they mention no one particular evill word or deed, I hope your Lordſhip, after ſo many arguments upon the generall ſentence of deprivation, and degradation, and this argument of mine upon the ſpeciall matter; will remember, that in <hi>generalibus latet fraus,</hi> and <hi>vir doloſus verſatur in univerſalibus;</hi> and will then conceive, that that which they ſay, was ſpoken and done very malepertly, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently, and arrogantly, was ſpoken and done diſcreetly, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and heroically; that I might to the utmoſt of my power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Kings ſupreame Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction over the Clergy, according as I was, and am expreſſely bound by the oath of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie; and then there is no fault at all, either in my words, or wager, in the things or circumſtances.</p>
            <p>But now my Lord, though that one circumſtance be falſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:95226:55"/>
the Defendants according to their own law, are not to be credited in the acceſſories; becauſe they have falſified the Law in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalls. Yet my Lord, ſeeing we are now in a demurrer, according to the nature of a demurrer, let all be granted in theſe three firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſories, that the Defendants themſelves affirme. Let the words be uttered very malepertly and irreverently, let the wager be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a very arrogant and irreſpective manner; let the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con at the ſame time be in Saint <hi>Margarets</hi> Church in <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> at the Viſitation among the Clergie, and ſitting there to heare Cauſes.

            <p>The Defendants, as your Lordſhip may remember, charge me with ſix particulars; amongſt which they make my refuſall to preach the Viſitation Sermon, and my maintaining it to be the Arch-deacons duty to preach his own Viſitation Sermon, the two principall or eſpeciall faults. And if they two be the principall and eſpeciall faults; then by the force of compariſon drawne from the adverſaries own eſtimate, the other foure muſt needs be inferiour and acceſſory. And then if the principall and eſpeciall faults be no faults, no breach of any Law; much leſſe can the inferiours or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſories be any faults, or any breaches of Law; for <hi>ſi principalis cauſanon ſubſiſtat, ea quae ſequuntur locum non habent.</hi> Now I have before ſhewed, that the two principall or eſpeciall faults are no faults, but vertues and eminent vertues, even the vertues of Canonicall obedience; and therefore the other foure being in the Defendants own judgement leſſer and inferiour vices, than the two former, they cannot be any faults, but muſt needs be vertues, and greater and ſuperior vertues. And the Defendants cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt this conſequence, becauſe it is neceſſarily drawne from their own eſtimate and teſtimony, and <hi>teſtimonium ab adverſario contra ſe fortiſſimum.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">acceſſory. </seg>The fourth</label> Now for the fourth and laſt acceſſory; my refuſall to performe the ſubmiſſion, <hi>conceptis verbis,</hi> which the Defendants pretend to be a great affront and contempt both to the Kings ſupremacy, and to the High-Commiſſion authority, ſeeing therein I was enjoyned to acknowledge my refuſall to preach the Arch-deacons Viſitation Sermon, at the Arch-deacons and Arch-biſhops mandate, to be a breach of Canonicall obedience. It is certain my Lord, that if that my refuſall to preach that Sermon be no breach of Canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb facs="tcp:95226:56"/>
then my refuſall to perform that ſubmiſſion, <hi>conceptis ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> is no affront or contempt, either to the Kings, or Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners authority. And if I make good the former, the Defendants muſt of neceſſity grant the latter.</p>
            <p>And for the cleering of this former, it is to be obſerved; that there is a two-fold Canonicall obedience, the one due to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons only, the other to the Prelates mandate according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. To the former, we are bound by the Canons themſelves, and by his Majeſties Letters Patents confirming the Canons. To the latter, we are beſide bound by the Prelates mandate, and by the oath of Canonicall obedience. The breach of the former, in all ſuch as ſubmit unto the canons, is but only diſobedience. The breach of the latter, is not only diſobedience, but alſo contumacie, yea and perjury too, in all them that have taken the oath of Canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>This will appeare, my Lord, by the oath of Canonicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, extant in the inſtrument of my Admiſſion, and Inſtitution (which I have here to ſhew) wherein the oath runs thus; <hi>Te pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitus de legitima &amp; Canonica obedientia, nobis &amp; ſucceſſoribus noſtris in omnibus licitis &amp; honeſtis mandatis per te praeſtanda &amp; exhibenda, ad ſancta Evangelia ritè junatum admittimus,</hi> we admit thee, ſaith the Ordinary, having firſt been rightly ſworn by the holy Goſpels, to perform lawfull and Canonicall obedience to us, and our ſucceſſours, in all lawfull and honeſt mandates.</p>
            <p>In which words, my Lord, it is firſt to be obſerv'd, that the thing that I ſweare, is not arbitrary and blinde obedience, that is ſuch obedience as the Prelate ſhall require by his Dictates, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be; but lawfull and Canonicall obedience; that is, ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience as the Canons and Eccleſiaſticall lawes of this Land re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Secondly, that the perſons to whom I have ſworn, are only the Biſhop and his ſucceſſours, not the Arch-deacon: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though I am bound to yeeld Canonicall obedience to all the Arch-deacons lawfull and honeſt mandates, yet I am not by oath bound thereunto; and therefore when I violate his lawfull and honeſt mandates, I commit only contumacie not perjury, And laſtly, that I have not ſworne this Canonicall obedience to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons themſelves; for then every time I broke a Canon. I ſhould commit perjury: but only to the Biſhop, and his ſucceſſours man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates nor to his words or private letters, or poſtſcripts, or meſſages; but only to his and his ſucceſſours mandates; no, nor to al their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates

neither, but only to all their lawfull and honeſt mandates.</p>

And ſo accordingly there is a two-fold contumacie, <hi>contumacia in non apparendo</hi> and <hi>contumacia in non parendo;</hi> a contumacie in not appearing, and a contumacie in not obeying. The contumacie in not appearing, is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95226:57"/>
committed when we violate the Prelates mandate for our appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his Court. The contumacie in not obeying, is committed, when we violate the Prelates mandate, enjoyning us to obey ſome act of his Court: and without one of theſe mandates firſt had and received, neither of theſe contumacies can be committed.</p>
            <p>Now with what contumacy do the Defendants charge me? not with any contumacy in not appearing: neither can they, for neither did the Archdeacon, no nor my Lords Grace neither, ſend out any mandate, to command me to appeare, either at their Archidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conall, Epiſcopall, or Archiepiſcopall Courts, and I alwaies obſerved the mandates of the High-commiſſion court for my appearance. So that they neither can nor do charge me with any contumacy in not appearing. They onely charge me with contumacy in not obeying the Archdeacons and Archbiſhops mandates, commanding mee to preach the Archdeacons viſitation ſermon.</p>
            <p>This appeares my Lord, out of their owne ſentence for in the firſt part of their firſt finall ſentence, alleaged in their plea, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants ſay; <hi>Super aperientiam cauſae, ipſi invenerunt Georgium Huntley ſpecialiter oneratum in articulis praedictis cum duobus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulariis, primo pro recuſatione ad praedicandum viſitationis ſermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, ad requiſitionem &amp; mandatum Archidiaconi diaeceſis, ſcilicet praedicti Willielmi Kingſley in Contrarium ſuae canonicae obedientiae.</hi> And afterward in the firſt part of that firſt finall ſentence, they ſay, that I violated the Archbiſhops mandate in the ſame matter, <hi>quod quidem mandatum dicti Archiepiſcopi, dictus Georgius Huntley, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam neglexit,</hi> and afterwards in the ſecond part of that firſt finall ſentence, they charge me with perjurie for violating, that my Lords Graces mandate.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, if I have violated my canonicall obedience to the Archdeacons and Archbiſhops mandate, and therein have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted diſobedience, contumacy and perjury, as the Defendants
<pb facs="tcp:95226:57"/>
pretend: then I have violated ſome Canon, and ſome Canonicall mandate of the Archdeacons and Archbiſhops, Canonicall both for forme and matter; where theſe three concurre, a Canon and a mandate Canonicall, both for forme and matter: there if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that breaks them, hath taken the oath of Canonicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he committeth anticanonicall diſobedience, contumacie, and perjury. But where the firſt of theſe is wanting where there is no Canon, there, there cannot be a Canonicall mandate for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and though there may be a Canonicall mandate for forme; yet when the other two are wanting, the breach of that only, is neither contumacie, nor perjury; no, nor any anticanonicall diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience neither; much leſſe can there be any anticanonicall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, contumacie, and perjury, when all the three former are wanting.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee, my Lord, which of the three former, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants can ſhew againſt me. Firſt, can they ſhew any Canon that bindes me to preach the Viſitation Sermon? No, the Canons, as I have before ſhewed, binde every Viſiter, every Archdeacon, Biſhop and Archbiſhop to preach his own Viſitation Sermon, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Preachers, to preach at their own Cures only, and forbid me, and ſuch as I am, that are not licenſed Preachers, to preach, or expound any Scripture, in our own Cures or elſe-where.</p>
            <p>Secondly, can the Defendants ſhew any mandate Canonicall for matter, ſent from the Archdeacon, or Archbiſhop to command, me to preach the Viſitation Sermon? Why, that's impoſſible; for ſeeing the Canons do not only not command, but forbid me to preach at my own Cure, or elſe-where. The mandate that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to preach at the Viſitation; muſt of neceſſity be for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not only uncanonicall, pretercanonicall, or ultracanonicall but alſo anticanonicall or contracanonicall.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, can the Defendants ſhew any mandate, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall for forme of the Archdeacons, or of his Graces, ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, to command me to preach the Viſitation Sermon? If they can then they can ſhew ſome publicke inſtrument out of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, or Arch-biſhops Court, made in the Arch-deacons, or Archbiſhops name, under the ſeale of their Office, and the hand of a publicke Notary, commanding me to preach the Viſitation Sermon. If they can do ſo, though that mandate for matter be not only beyond the Canons, but contrary to the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nons; and their mandates ought not to exceed the Canons: yet let them onely
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95226:58"/>
ſhew, that canonicall mandate for forme, that publicke inſtrument out of the Archdeacons, or Archbiſhops court, made in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, or Archbiſhops name, under the ſeale of their Office, and the hand of a Publick-Notary, commanding me to preach the Archdeacons Viſitation Sermon: and I will be ſo indulgent unto them, that I will acknowledge my ſelfe culpable of contumacie, in diſobeying ſuch a canonicall mandate of the Arch-deacons for forme, though uncanonicall, and anticanonicall for matter; and both of contumacie, and perjury, in diſobeying ſuch a canonicall mandate of his Graces for forme, though uncanonicall, and antica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall for matter. Can they do it?</p>
            <p>No, no, my Lord, in their Plea, the Defendants confeſſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; they only mention three private letters written to me, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire me to preach the Viſitation Sermon, one from his Grace in the ſeventh Article, another from Sir <hi>George Newman,</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons Officiall, in the ninth article; and another from the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon himſelfe in the eleventh article.</p>
            <p>But private letters, my Lord, are no canonicall mandates for forme: neither am I tied by oath, to performe canonicall obedience to the Prelates private letters, but only to his mandates; to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke inſtruments out of the Prelates Court, made in the Prelates name, under the ſeale of his Office, and the hand of a Publicke-Notary: and unleſſe the Defendants can produce ſome ſuch cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall mandate for forme, ſent unto me, to command me to preach the Viſitation Sermon; they cannot make any ſhew or colour, that I have committed either any contumacie, or perjury; no, nor any anticanonicall diſobedience neither.</p>
            <p>Nay my Lord, unleſſe the Defendants can ſhew ſuch a canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call mandate for forme, ſent from the Archdeacon to me, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me preach his viſitation Sermon, they cannot make any ſhew or colour, that I have broken the order of the High Commiſſion Court, in refuſing to preach the Archdeacons viſitation Sermon. For in the firſt part of their finall ſentence, given the eighth of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1626. the High Commiſſion Court made an Order, that upon the Archdeacons mandate, and a competent warning thereby to mee given, I ſhould preach a Sermon at the next viſitation, to be holden by the Archdeacon. Theſe are the very words of their ſentence or Order upon record in this Court. <hi>Nihilominus dicta curia alta com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsionis, ad tempus illud reſervans ſibi ipſis eorum ulteriores cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuras, prout occaſio oblata foret, pro co tempore tantum mode ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit

ipſum dictum Georgium Huntley, ſuper mandatum praedicti Archidiaconi Cant. ſuper competenti monitione ei danda, ad prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicandum ſermorem ad proximam viſitationem, tenendam per magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum Archidiaconum Cantuarien.</hi> So that by their owne Order extant in the Defendants plea, I was not bound to preach that next viſitation Sermon <hi>niſi ſuper mandatum Archidiaconi Cant. &amp; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per competenti monitione mihi danda.</hi> But upon the Archdeacons mandate, and upon competent warning, thereby to me given; So that by their owne order, the Archdeacon was firſt to ſend his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to the Apparitor, and then the Apparitor by vertue of that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, was to warne mee, to preach that next viſitation Sermon.</p>
            <p>Now did the Archdeacon at that his next viſitation, ſend out ſuch a mandate, ſuch a publicke inſtrument out of his Court, made in his owne name, under the ſeale of his office, and the hand of a publicke notary, to his apparitor, to enable him to warne me to preach that his next viſitation Sermon? can the defendants ſhew any ſuch mandate or proceſſe, ſent from the Archdeacon to the Apparitor for that purpoſe. No, no, my Lord, the Defendants confeſſe the contrary in their plea: they acknowledge in the ſecond part of their firſt finall ſentence, given the ninteenth of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1627. extant in their plea, that <hi>George Huntley</hi> then alleaged in his owne behalfe, <hi>quod Praedictus magiſter Archidiaconus non admonuiſſet cum per le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galem proceſſum:</hi> and they grant it, that there was no legall mandate or proceſſe, ſent by the Archdeacon to the Apparitor for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſo that by their owne confeſſion in their plea, in refuſing to preach that viſitation Sermon, I have neither committed any anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canonicall diſobedience, contumacy, nor perjury, no nor tranſgreſſed the order of the High-commiſſion court, becauſe there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe or mandate ſent from the Archdeacon to the Apparitor, to warne me to preach that ſermon, as there ſhould have beene accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne Order.</p>
            <p>What then doe they alleage againſt me? onely this my Lord; That it appeared to the Court by affidavit made, <hi>quod praedictus Magiſter Archidiaconus dediſſet ej ſufficientem admonitionem per publicum officiarium.</hi> That Maſter Archdeacon had ſent an Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or publicke officer to warne me, to Preach the Uiſitation Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. There's the warning indeed, given by the apparitor, and I confeſſe it: yea but where is the Archdeacons mandate or proceſſe to the apparitour, to enable him to warne me to preach that ſermon? That my Lord is either ſhrunke in the wetting, or loſt in the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95226:59"/>
for they themſelves grant, that that apparitour or publike offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, had no mandate or legall proceſſe from the Archdeacon, to warne me to preach that ſermon.</p>
            <p>And then my Lord, how have I tranſgreſt, either the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons mandate, or the order of the High-commiſſion Court, or what authority had that apparitor, or publik officer, to warne mee to preach that Uiſitation Sermon? juſt none at all, as appeares by the 138. canon, made 1. <hi>Iacobit</hi> where it is ſaid, all apparitors ſhall by themſelves, faithfully execute their offices, neither ſhall they by any colour, or pretence whatſoever, cauſe or ſuffer their mandates to bee executed, by any meſſengers or ſubſtitutes.</p>
            <p>In which words my Lord it appeares, that an apparitor doth then faithfully execute his office, when he doth faithfully execute his mandates, that is, neither goe beyond, nor come ſhort of his mandates, ſo that the apparitours have no power to warne or ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon any man with out ſuch a mandate.</p>
            <p>No, nor the Biſhop, Chancellour, Archdeacon, Officiall, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Eccleſiaſticall Judge, as appears by this 120 Canon. No Biſhop, Chancellour, Archdeacon, Officiall, or other Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Judge, ſhall ſuffer any generall Proceſſes of <hi>Quorum nomina,</hi> to be ſent out of his Court, except the names of all ſuch, as thereby are to be cited: ſhall be firſt expreſſely entred by the hand of the Regeſter or his deputy, under the ſaid Proceſſes; and the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and names be firſt ſubſcribed, by the Judge, or his deputy, and his ſeale thereto affixed. So that whenſoever any Biſhop or any other Eccleſiaſticall Judge, will cite any man to appear before him; he muſt ſend out by his Apparitor a mandate, or proceſſe and therein the name of the party to be cited, muſt be firſt entred by the Regeſter, or his deputy, and then ſubſcribed by the Judge, or his deputy, and his ſeale thereto affixed.</p>
            <p>And if any Eccleſiaſticall Judge whatſoever, ſhall by his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritor without ſuch a proceſſe or mandate, Summon any man to appeare before him, the party is not bound to appeare; and though he do not appear, yet he is not culpable of any contumacy, as appears by this 122 Canon.</p>
            <p>When any Miniſter is complained of in any Eccleſiaſticall Court belonging to any Biſhop of this Province, for any crime: the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, Commiſſary Officiall, or any other, having Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call juriſdiction, to whom it ſhall appertaine ſhall expedite the cauſe by proceſſes, and other proceedings againſt him; and upon contumacy for not appearing, ſhall ſuſpend him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:95226:59"/>Firſt then, after complaint made againſt any one, the Judge muſt cite the party by proceſſe to appeare before him; if the party obey not the proceſſe, he is then contumacious; but without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe there is no contumacy.</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhip ſhall aske me what authority the Apparitour pretended when he warned me to preach the ſaid Viſitation Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. I anſwer, that he pretended a proceſſe or mandate from the Archdeacon: and it is true, my Lord, that he had a proceſſe and mandate from the Archdeacon, and yet no proceſſe or mandate from him. He had a proceſſe or mandate to warne me to appeare at the Archdeacons Viſitation, and there to pay my procurations due to him for Viſiting; and that proceſſe or mandate was a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke inſtrument out of the Archdeacons Court, made in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons name, under the ſeale of his Office, and the hand of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Notary.</p>
            <p>But he had no ſuch mandate or proceſſe, to warne me to preach the Archdeacons Viſitation Sermon; but only an<note n="*" place="margin">In this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, Doctor Kingſley, and the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners are more Popiſh and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, than the Pope himſelfe.

                     <hi>I</hi> Marvell, that being a member of the High-Commiſsion, you ſhould not better obſerve the order of that Honorable Court. Their order is, that you muſt command me to preach a Viſitation Sermon, and that I muſt obey your command, and this they ſay is the cuſtome. And therfore as I muſt obey according to cuſtome, ſo you muſt command according to cuſtome. What the cuſtome in this point is, Sir <hi>George Newmans</hi> anſwer <hi>ad ſeptimum articulum</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares; who there depoſeth, that for theſe thirty years of his own knowledge, the Archdeacon of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for the time being, hath ſent Proceſſe by his Apparitor, to command the Ministers to preach at his Viſitation. Do you obſerve this cuſtome, command me by Proceſſe to preach at your Viſitation, and I will preach a ſermon for your Viſitation, as effectually as I can. Your Apparitor ſhewed me Proceſſe, and no Proceſſe; Proceſſe to command me to appeare at your Viſitation, no Proceſſe to command me to preach at your Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. When you conceive meanly, and not evilly of me, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as I my ſelfe do, and both aright; yet if I may ſpeak it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arrogancie, I am not ſo ſtupid and obtuſe, but that I can diſcerne between the Text, and a marginall Note; which corrupts the Text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Canon, and the Apocrypha; between the Proceſſe for my appearance, made in the Archdeacons name, confirmed with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke ſeale of his Court, ſubſcribed with the hand of his Regeſter, and an unwarrantable and an unjuſtifiable additament or poſtſcript, which hath neither hand or ſeale unto it: whoſe Author is anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95226:60"/>
whoſe authority apocryphall, which hath no warrant or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the Proceſſe, nay, which quite out-ſtrips the Proceſſe. The Proceſſe commands me only to appeare, and pay procurations; which ſaith your Proceſſe, are due to you for Viſiting; this is, ſaith the Canon Law, for preaching and correcting. <hi>Decretal. lib. 3. tit. 39. De Cenſibus &amp;c. cap. 23. parag. Porro. &amp; Sexti Decretal. lib, 3. tit. 20. De Cenſibus &amp;c. cap. 1. par. Sane. &amp; par. Hanc autem.</hi> But the poſtſcript commands me to preach, which is more than to appear; It is to appear, and to do ſomething elſe, namely, to performe one part of the Viſiters duty, for which I pay my procurations. If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command me to appeare without Proceſſe, can you command me to preach (which is more than to appeare) by a poſtſcript, which is leſſe than Proceſſe, which is no Proceſſe, no part of your Proceſſe? If you command me by Proceſſe to pay procurations; which ſay you, are due to you for Viſiting, that is, for preaching and correcting? Will you by a poſtſcript command me to do your principall duty, namely, to preach at your Viſitation, for which I pay my procurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? This poſtſcript then is faulty, in a double reſpect; it exceeds your Proceſſe, and is contrary to your Proceſſe. It exceeds your Proceſſe, becauſe it commands me to preach at your Viſitation, your Proceſſe commands me to appeare only. It is contrary to your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, becauſe it makes it my duty to preach at your Viſitation, your Proceſſe makes it yours. It is your duty to viſit, that is to preach and correct, and for that it requires procurations. And what ſmall authority your Proceſſe and poſtſcript have, to compell me to preach at your Viſitation; the wiſedome of your Advocates may teach you, who would not produce either in open Court, although they were thereunto urged by my Counſell; for thereby they ſhould have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered your moſt palpable uſurpation, who command that by poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, which you dare not do by Proceſſe, and yet pretend you doe it by Proceſſe; becauſe the Proceſſe and poſtſcript are both written upon one ſheet of paper, although the poſtſcript hath no correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie with the Proceſſe, becauſe it is not made in your name, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with the ſeale of your Office, ſubſcribed with your Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters hand, neither hath any warrant or confirmation, in or by the Proceſſe. If you will have me take this poſtſcript for a Proceſſe, you muſt either put it into the body of the Proceſſe, or elſe like a Proceſse, make it in your owne name, confirme it with the ſeale of your Office, ſubſcribe it with your Regeſters hand, and then I will take it for Proceſse, and obey it as Proceſse. Without one of theſe

you neither obſerve the order of the Court, nor the cuſtome, which you ſtrive for; and in your breife alleage Sir <hi>George Newmans</hi> teſtimony to prove it. Do you obſerve both theſe and I will breake neither. And ſo deſiring you to command me by Proceſſe to preach at your Viſitation or to provide a Sermon elſewhere, I commend you to the Almighty, and reſt</p>

my juſt Judges, in the preſence of a moſt juſt God, for a juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a juſt man ſhould do, both for my ſelfe and for my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Firſt for my adverſaries, if their Cauſe be better then mine, and they can confute what I have ſaid: and if they cannot, then for myſelfe, and for both ſpeedily without all further delay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all further procraſtination; for it hath been fall twelve years three quarters, ſince this action firſt began in this Court; full twelve years three quarters, before I could get this firſt hearing, this one Argument. A long and a tedious time, in which divers intereſſed in this controverſie have ended their lives: and as <hi>Iulian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, though an Apoſtata ſaies. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.<note place="margin">Epiſtola 35.</note> It is a fearful a terrible thing, that he that ſues for juſtice, ſhall ſooner lay down his life at the judgement ſeat, then procure judgement from the juſt Judges that ſit upon the ſeat: that he ſhall ſtand in need of two lives to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine one controverſie, and yet end them both, before he can end that his one controverſie.</p>
            <p>What a blemiſh and diſgrace is it, that the juſtice of private men, ſhall exceed and ſurpaſſe the juſtice of Judges, and of Courts of juſtice? and if private men do all that ever they can to have their Cauſes heard, and determined; and Judges do all that ever they can, to delay, procraſtinate, and ſtave off the hearing and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of them; doth; not the juſtice of private men exceed and ſurmount the juſtice of judges, and of Courts of juſtice?</p>
            <p>And yet the juſtice of private men is but the private and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar juſtice of the Kingdome; and if there be any queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, it muſt paſſe <hi>per libram per trutinam, ſub examine juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae judicum &amp; Curiarum.</hi> And therefore the juſtice of Iudges and of Courts of juſtice is the generall, univerſall, aecumenicall, epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall juſtice of the Kingdom. The light of the body ſaith our Saviour is the eye; if that light be darkneſſe, how great is that darkneſſe? So the generall, univerſall, aecumenicall, epidemicall juſtice of the Kingdome, is the juſtice of Iudges, and of Courts of juſtice. If that juſtice be injuſtice, how great is that injuſtice? It is then the generall univerſall, aecumenicall, epidemicall plague peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, conſumption, deſolation, and deſtruction of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>And though, my Lord the difficulty to get juſtice, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to loſe it, is alwaies very great; becauſe there are ſo many things needfull, even in an honeſt courſe to prevaile in a ſute at
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95226:62"/>
Law, as a good and a juſt cauſe, a diligent, faithfull, and expert Solicitor, an honeſt, skilfull, and incorrupt Attourney, a learned, faithfull and couragious Counſell, and a juſt and an upright Iudge; of which if any one faile to do his duty, a good cauſe may have an ill ſucceſſe: Yet certainly amongſt all the former, next after a a good Cauſe, a juſt and an upright Iudge is the principall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall. And becauſe even in a good Cauſe, the three former cannot prevaile without this latter, and this latter can and may correct and amend the faults and errors of the three former; therefore <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour makes this latter the only neceſſary thing, to prevaile in a good Cauſe. His words are worthy to be ingraven in letters of gold, on every Court of juſtice, for a direction and caution to all Iudges, Counſellours, Atturnyes, Solicitours, and Clients. <gap reason="foreign">

If the Iudge either cannot, or will not, if either through weakneſſe he cannot apprehend the truth, or elſe through wickedneſſe will not heare, or will betray the truth; there is then a neceſſity, that right and juſtice moſt be ſubverted.</p>
            <p>Wherefore my Honoured Lord Chiefe Iuſtice, and Honoured Iudges; to the intent that your Lordſhip and the Court may ſhew your ſelves ſuch Iudges as men oppreſſed according to <hi>Iulians</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, ſhould ſeeke for; ſuch Iudges as both can and will judge rightly, can and will do Iuſtice; ſuch Iudges as both can and will rectifie and reforme the faults and errors of Solicitours, Atturneys, and Counſellors; nay ſuch Iudges; as in a good cauſe will ſupply the want of all theſe, which is my caſe for I can get none of them.

            <p>Or if you have any better right to be called Iuſtices, yet without the works of juſtice, it is only <hi>ratione officii,</hi> not <hi>ratione meriti;</hi> and in that ſence, as the Papiſts ſay, if <hi>Iudas</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus</hi> were Popes, they had right to, and might be honoured with the title of holineſſe.

compleat rule of juſtice: The obſervation whereof, will make you all, not only Iuſtices, but alſo chiefe Iuſtices; if not <hi>ratione loci, tituli, &amp; officii,</hi> which is the inferiour; yet <hi>ratione operis &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riti,</hi> which is the ſuperiour; and will make <hi>ſuum cuique,</hi> which is <hi>anima, vigor, &amp; executio legis,</hi> take place in every cauſe that comes before you: wherein next after the ſervice and worſhip of God, and the exerciſe of the true Orthodox Religion, conſiſts the welfare and flouriſhing eſtate, both of Church and Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>And this my Lord, will be the beſt, if not the only courſe, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the credit of this your Court, and to confute that opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſtinction of Court Chriſtian, and not Chriſtian; whereby the name of Court Chriſtian is appropriated only to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Courts, and all Temporal Courts reputed Ethnick or heatheniſh, but both very erroneouſly. For it is the doing of juſtice, that makes Courts Chriſtian and the omitting or neglect of juſtice, much more the doing of injuſtice, that makes Courts Ethnick or Heatheniſh, as the Apoſtle ſhewes in his 1. Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinths</hi> 6. chapter, 1. verſ. <hi>Dare any of you having a matter againſt another, be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the unjuſt, and not under the Saints?</hi> which Apoſtolicall Dichotomy, if it be rightly made, and the members thereof truly oppoſite; then they which are unjuſt, cannot be Saints or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and they which are Saints or Chriſtians, cannot be unjuſt. And to make the matter more cleare, thoſe whom the Apoſtle in the firſt verſe calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> unjuſt, thoſe in the 6. verſe, he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers or infidells. And thoſe whom the Apoſtle calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Saints or Chriſtians, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calls doers of righteouſnes; <hi>If you know that Chriſt is righteous know ye, that every one that doth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is borne of him,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, 2. chap. 29. verſe. and in his 3. chap. 7, verſe, he calls them both righteous, and doers of righteouſneſſe. He that doth righteouſneſſe, is righteous, even as Chriſt is righteous. And therefore, my Lord, that Court which doth juſtice, is a Court Chriſtian, and that Court which doth not do juſtice, is a Court not Chriſtian. If the Eccleſiaſticall Court doth juſtice more cheerefully, readily, and freely, than the Temporall Court, then the Eccleſiaſticall Court is more Chriſtian; if the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Court doth juſtice more cheerefully, readily, and freely, than the Eccleſiaſticall Court, then the temporall Court is more Chriſtian; if they both do juſtice, as they both ſhould do, then both are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, if neither do juſtice, then neither is Chriſtian. Or if both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and Temporall Iudges, will have themſelves, and their
<pb facs="tcp:95226:64"/>
Courts reputed chriſtian, though they do not do juſtice; yet they muſt be content to be ranked among thoſe chriſtians, who profeſſe they know God, but by their works deny him. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. or among thoſe, who have indeed a ſhew, or forme of godlineſſe, but have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the power thereof. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>Wherefore my honoured Lord Chiefe Iuſtice, and my honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Iudges, to the intent that you may ſhew yourſelves and this your Court truly Chriſtian; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
